## Generating Coverage Reports

```bash
# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# View coverage report
# Coverage files are generated in the coverage/ directory
# Open coverage/lcov-report/index.html in a browser
```

## Coverage Analysis Tools

- **Jest Coverage**: Built-in Jest coverage reporting
- **LCOV Reports**: HTML reports in `coverage/lcov-report/`
- **Coverage Thresholds**: Configured in `jest.config.js`

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Reviews**: Review coverage reports after each major feature
2. **Gap Analysis**: Identify and document coverage gaps
3. **Prioritization**: Focus on critical paths first
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Gradually increase coverage over time
5. **Quality over Quantity**: Focus on meaningful tests, not just coverage percentage

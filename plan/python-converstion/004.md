## TASK-PY-004: Implement Structured Logging

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Implement `cursor_executor/services/logger.py` that:
  - [ ] Configures `logging` with JSON or key-value output (level, timestamp, message, service, requestId, queueType, repository).
  - [ ] Respects a `LOG_LEVEL` env var.
- [ ] Provide helper functions to attach context (e.g., requestId, conversationId) to log entries.
- [ ] Replace any initial `print` statements in Python code with structured logger calls.

### Testing
- [ ] Add `tests/test_logger.py` that:
  - [ ] Captures a sample log record and asserts required fields are present.
  - [ ] Verifies log level can be adjusted via env.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All modules use the shared logger.
- [ ] Logging format and fields are consistent and suitable for production monitoring.

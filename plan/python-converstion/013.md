## TASK-PY-013: Implement Cursor Execution Service (Execute / Iterate)

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Implement `cursor_executor/services/cursor_execution_service.py`:
  - [ ] `execute` method that prepares prompts, attaches system instructions, validates repositories/workspace trust, invokes `CursorCLI`, and records conversation context.
  - [ ] `iterate` method that:
    - [ ] Loops up to `maxIterations`.
    - [ ] Logs memory usage.
    - [ ] Handles partial output on errors and updates conversation.
    - [ ] Triggers summarization on context-window errors.
  - [ ] Callback webhook logic for async flows (building payloads, handling errors without crashing workers).

### Testing
- [ ] Add `tests/test_cursor_execution_service.py` with extensive mocks of `CursorCLI`, git, filesystem, workspace trust, and conversation services.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Execution flows (sync and async) match Node semantics, with tests covering success, failures, and context-window behavior.

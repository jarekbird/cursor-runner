## TASK-PY-005: Implement SQLite Migration Framework

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Create `cursor_executor/migrations/` containing:
  - [ ] A migration runner abstraction (Python equivalent of `src/migrations/migration-runner.ts`).
  - [ ] A CLI entry (e.g., `cursor_executor/migrations/cli.py`) that supports `migrate`, `rollback`, `status`.
- [ ] Port migration files:
  - [ ] Create Python migrations that mirror:
    - Schema migrations table.
    - System settings table.
    - Tasks table.
    - Git credentials table.
    - Telegram bots table.
- [ ] Design migrations to be idempotent and safe on repeated runs.

### Testing
- [ ] Add `tests/test_migrations.py` that:
  - [ ] Creates a temp SQLite DB.
  - [ ] Runs migrations twice and verifies:
    - Schema is correct.
    - No errors on the second run.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Migration CLI can create and update the SQLite schema equivalent to Node's.
- [ ] Migrations are idempotent and covered by tests.

# TASK-PY-001.04: Create Baseline Documentation

**Section**: 1. Baseline & Preparation
**Subsection**: 1.1.4
**Task ID**: TASK-PY-001.04
**Parent Task**: TASK-PY-001
**Order**: 4 of 4 (Fourth and final subtask in TASK-PY-001)

## Description

This subtask consolidates all baseline information from previous subtasks into a comprehensive baseline document. This document serves as the single source of truth for the reference state of the Node.js implementation.

**Reference Implementation**: Results from TASK-PY-001.01, 001.02, 001.03

## Current State

- TASK-PY-001.01, 001.02, 001.03 have been completed
- Individual verification results exist but are not consolidated
- No comprehensive baseline document exists

**Important**: This subtask must be completed after all other 001 subtasks to consolidate all information.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Gather all information from previous subtasks:
  - [ ] Commit SHA from 001.01
  - [ ] Test results from 001.02
  - [ ] File verification results from 001.03
- [ ] Review baseline.md template or create structure

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create baseline document structure
  - [ ] Create `plan/python-converstion/baseline.md`
  - [ ] Add sections:
    - [ ] Repository Information
    - [ ] Commit Information
    - [ ] Test Status
    - [ ] File Verification Results
    - [ ] Notes and Discrepancies
- [ ] Step 2: Populate repository information
  - [ ] Primary reference repository path
  - [ ] Alternative repository paths checked
  - [ ] Branch names
  - [ ] Date/time of baseline capture
- [ ] Step 3: Populate commit information
  - [ ] Commit SHA (40-character hash)
  - [ ] Commit message
  - [ ] Branch name
  - [ ] Verification that SHA can be checked out
- [ ] Step 4: Populate test status
  - [ ] Test pass/fail status
  - [ ] Number of tests run
  - [ ] Number of tests passed/failed/skipped
  - [ ] Test coverage percentage (if available)
  - [ ] Node.js and npm versions
- [ ] Step 5: Populate file verification results
  - [ ] Status of each key file checked
  - [ ] Any discrepancies found
  - [ ] Impact assessment of discrepancies
- [ ] Step 6: Add notes and discrepancies
  - [ ] Any uncommitted changes documented
  - [ ] Any known issues
  - [ ] Any deviations from master plan
  - [ ] Recommendations for porting

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Complete information
  - Acceptance criteria: All information from previous subtasks is included
  - Acceptance criteria: No critical information is missing
- [ ] Requirement 2: Accurate information
  - Acceptance criteria: Commit SHA is correct and verifiable
  - Acceptance criteria: Test results are accurate
  - Acceptance criteria: File verification is accurate
- [ ] Requirement 3: Usable format
  - Acceptance criteria: Document is readable and well-organized
  - Acceptance criteria: Information can be easily referenced
  - Acceptance criteria: Document is in markdown format

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle case where information is missing: Document what's missing and why
- [ ] Handle case where information conflicts: Resolve conflicts and document resolution
- [ ] Handle case where format is unclear: Use clear, consistent formatting

### Testing

- [ ] Verify all required information is present
- [ ] Verify commit SHA can be checked out using documented SHA
- [ ] Verify document is readable and well-formatted
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - this is a documentation task

### Documentation

- [ ] Baseline document is complete and accurate
- [ ] Document follows consistent format
- [ ] Document is committed to repository

### Verification

- [ ] Verify baseline document contains all required information
- [ ] Verify information is accurate
- [ ] Verify document is committed to git

## Notes

- This subtask is part of TASK-PY-001
- **Execution Timing**: Execute after TASK-PY-001.01, 001.02, 001.03
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-PY-001.01: Commit SHA needed
  - TASK-PY-001.02: Test results needed
  - TASK-PY-001.03: File verification needed
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - This document is the foundation for all porting work
  - It must be accurate and complete
  - It should be easy to reference during porting
- **Task Independence**: This subtask depends on all other 001 subtasks

## Related Tasks

- Parent: TASK-PY-001 (Confirm Baseline `cursor-runner` State)
- Previous: TASK-PY-001.03 (Verify Key Source Files)
- Next: TASK-PY-002 (Create Python Project Skeleton)
- Dependencies:
  - TASK-PY-001.01, 001.02, 001.03: All must be complete

## Definition of Done

This task involves **documentation** work.

**Description**: Tasks that involve creating or updating documentation files.

**Definition of Done**: "Baseline documentation is created with all required information and committed to git"

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer porting to Python**, I need comprehensive baseline documentation so I can reference the exact Node.js state throughout the port
- As a **developer**, I need consolidated baseline information so I don't have to search multiple sources

**Automated Tests**:
- Test that baseline.md file exists
- Test that all required sections are present
- Test that commit SHA is valid format
- Test that document is valid markdown

**Commit and Push Requirements**:
- [ ] Create baseline.md file
- [ ] Commit: `git add plan/python-converstion/baseline.md && git commit -m "TASK-PY-001.04: Create comprehensive baseline documentation"`
- [ ] Push to origin: `git push origin <branch-name>`
- [ ] Verify commit appears in remote repository

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] Baseline document exists with all required information
- [ ] Information is accurate and verifiable
- [ ] Document is well-organized and readable
- [ ] Document is committed to git
- [ ] TASK-PY-001 is complete (all subtasks done)

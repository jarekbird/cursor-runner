## TASK-PY-008: Implement Workspace Trust Service

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Implement `cursor_executor/services/workspace_trust_service.py`:
  - [ ] Enforce allowed roots for repositories and target apps.
  - [ ] Provide checks similar to Node's `workspace-trust-service.ts`.
- [ ] Integrate workspace trust checks into filesystem, git, and cursor-execution flows where appropriate.

### Testing
- [ ] Add `tests/test_workspace_trust_service.py` covering:
  - [ ] Allowed vs disallowed paths.
  - [ ] Behavior when trust configuration is missing or invalid.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Workspace trust is enforced consistently in Python, with tests demonstrating security behavior.

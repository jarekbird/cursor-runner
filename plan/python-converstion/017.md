## TASK-PY-017: Docker, Compose, and CI Integration

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Create a Python `Dockerfile` for `cursor-executor`:
  - [ ] Install dependencies, copy code, run tests at build (optional).
- [ ] Update or create `docker-compose` files to:
  - [ ] Run Python service with Redis and SQLite volumes matching Node deployment.
- [ ] Add CI workflows or scripts to:
  - [ ] Run linters and formatters.
  - [ ] Run type checks.
  - [ ] Run `pytest` with coverage.

### Testing
- [ ] Build and run the Docker image locally; hit `/health` and a few core endpoints.
- [ ] Run CI pipeline locally or in GitHub to ensure all checks pass.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Python service can be built and run in containers alongside existing stack.
- [ ] CI reliably validates code quality and tests.

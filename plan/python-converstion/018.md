## TASK-PY-018: Integration with `jarek-va` and Rollout

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Identify all places where `jarek-va` calls `cursor-runner` and make the base URL configurable.
- [ ] Introduce a flag or environment switch to route traffic to `cursor-executor` instead of Node for test/staging.
- [ ] Run real-world tasks through `cursor-executor` and compare results with Node:
  - [ ] At least one complex feature task.
  - [ ] At least one review-agent flow.

### Testing
- [ ] Add integration tests or scripts in `jarek-va` that can target Python or Node backends.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] `cursor-executor` can be used as a drop-in replacement for `cursor-runner` in non-production environments.
- [ ] A clear path is documented for moving production traffic over once confidence is high.

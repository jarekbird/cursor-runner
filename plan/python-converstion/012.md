## TASK-PY-012: Implement Agent Conversation Service (Redis)

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Implement `cursor_executor/services/agent_conversation_service.py` mirroring Node's:
  - [ ] Create, list, get, and update agent conversations with pagination and sorting.
  - [ ] Store status fields (`active`, `completed`, `archived`, `failed`).
- [ ] Share Redis resilience patterns with the main conversation service.

### Testing
- [ ] Add `tests/test_agent_conversation_service.py` and `tests/test_agent_conversation_api_integration.py`:
  - [ ] Cover listing, pagination, sorting, and failure modes (Redis down).

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Agent conversation service mirrors Node behavior with tests covering primary flows and edge cases.

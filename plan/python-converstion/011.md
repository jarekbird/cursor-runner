## TASK-PY-011: Implement Conversation Service (Redis, Context, Summarization)

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Implement `cursor_executor/services/conversation_service.py`:
  - [ ] Manage conversations in Redis keyed by queue type (`default`, `telegram`, `api`).
  - [ ] Implement `get_conversation_id`, `create_conversation`, `add_message`, `get_conversation_context`, and summarization logic.
  - [ ] Implement graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable (generate new IDs, log warnings, stop persisting).
- [ ] Implement summarization behavior:
  - [ ] Detect context-window errors from output (based on patterns defined in Node).
  - [ ] Compress conversation history into a summary + recent messages and persist as summarized context.

### Testing
- [ ] Add `tests/test_conversation_service.py`:
  - [ ] Use an in-memory or mocked Redis client.
  - [ ] Cover normal, Redis-down, and summarization error cases.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Conversation service behavior (including summarization and degradation) is parity-checked against Node via tests.

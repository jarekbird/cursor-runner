## TASK-PY-010: Implement Cursor CLI Wrapper (Execution Semantics)

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Finish `cursor_executor/services/cursor_cli.py` with:
  - [ ] Concurrency semaphore mirroring `CURSOR_CLI_MAX_CONCURRENT`.
  - [ ] Main timeout and idle timeout behavior.
  - [ ] Safety timeout that guarantees semaphore release on edge cases.
  - [ ] Output-size caps.
  - [ ] Optional PTY-like behavior (if practical) for dealing with interactive prompts, or documented alternative.

### Testing
- [ ] Expand `tests/test_cursor_cli.py`:
  - [ ] Simulate long-running commands, idle commands, output floods.
  - [ ] Assert semaphore is always released.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Python cursor CLI wrapper can reproduce Node's timeout and concurrency behavior, per tests.

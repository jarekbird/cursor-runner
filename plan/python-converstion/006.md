## TASK-PY-006: Implement System Settings & Task Services (SQLite)

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Implement `cursor_executor/services/system_settings_service.py` (or similar) to:
  - [ ] Read/write system settings in SQLite using the migrated schema.
  - [ ] Provide `is_system_setting_enabled` with env-based fallback for debug flags.
- [ ] Implement `cursor_executor/services/task_service.py` mirroring Node's `task-service.ts`:
  - [ ] CRUD for tasks, including status filtering and ordering rules.
  - [ ] Consistent status labels and timestamp handling.

### Testing
- [ ] Add `tests/test_system_settings_service.py` and `tests/test_task_service.py` covering:
  - [ ] Creating, updating, reading, deleting settings and tasks.
  - [ ] Behavior when DB is unavailable or misconfigured.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] System settings and task services behave equivalently to Node's, per tests.

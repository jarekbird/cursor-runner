## TASK-PY-007: Implement Filesystem & File Tree Services

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Implement `cursor_executor/services/filesystem_service.py`:
  - [ ] Safe read/write helpers using `pathlib.Path.resolve()` and repository root constraints.
  - [ ] Clear error handling for non-existent paths, permission errors, and traversal attempts.
- [ ] Implement `cursor_executor/services/file_tree_service.py`:
  - [ ] Directory walking with ignore rules (mirroring Node behavior as much as feasible).
  - [ ] Sorted output (directories first, then files).

### Testing
- [ ] Add `tests/test_filesystem_service.py` and `tests/test_file_tree_service.py` mirroring Node tests.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Filesystem and file tree behaviors (including edge cases) are covered by tests and match Node expectations.

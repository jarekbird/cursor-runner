## TASK-PY-016: End-to-End Lite Flows & Edge-Case Parity

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Add E2E-lite tests (Python side) that:
  - [ ] Hit async iterate flows and verify callback behavior.
  - [ ] Exercise conversation and agent-conversation flows end-to-end (API → services → Redis/SQLite).
  - [ ] Exercise error paths (unknown repos, bad requests, internal errors) and verify response shapes.
- [ ] Compare behaviors and logs with Node for a small set of canonical scenarios.

### Testing
- [ ] Add tests under `tests/test_e2e_*` using a test app and temporary DBs.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Key workflows and edge cases behave equivalently between Node and Python, demonstrated by passing E2E-lite tests.

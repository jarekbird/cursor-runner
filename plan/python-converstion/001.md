## TASK-PY-001: Confirm Baseline `cursor-runner` State

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] In the Node `cursor-runner` repo, run `npm install` (if needed) and `npm test` to ensure all tests are passing.
- [ ] Verify there are no uncommitted changes in `VirtualAssistant/cursor-runner`, `assistant-integrations/cursor-runner`, and `python-cursor/cursor-runner` (or document any intentional local differences).
- [ ] Capture the current commit SHA and note it in a short baseline note in the `python-converstion` plan folder.
- [ ] Skim `server.ts`, `cursor-execution-service.ts`, `cursor-cli.ts`, `conversation-service.ts`, and `system-settings.ts` to confirm they match the assumptions in `master-plan.md`.

### Testing
- [ ] `npm test` passes in the canonical Node repo.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Baseline commit SHA is recorded.
- [ ] Node tests are green, establishing a stable reference behavior for the Python port.

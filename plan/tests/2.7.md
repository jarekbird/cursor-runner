### Step 2.7: CursorRunner Process & Signal Handling (Optional)
**Objective**: Test Node process main entrypoint and signal-driven shutdown.

**Tasks**:
1. Create `tests/process-signals.e2e.test.ts` (or extend an existing integration/E2E-lite file):
   - Build or import the compiled entrypoint so that the `import.meta.url` main guard is active.
   - Spawn the built artifact as a child process with a test configuration (mocked Redis/SQLite where needed).
   - Send `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` to the child process in separate tests.
   - Verify that the process exits with code `0` for both signals.
   - Verify that `shutdown()` is invoked (e.g., via log output or a lightweight test hook).
   - Verify that any keep-alive interval or timers are cleared (no hanging process; child exits within a reasonable timeout).

**Tests**:
- Use `child_process.spawn` to start the built runner.
- Use `process.kill(child.pid, 'SIGTERM')` / `'SIGINT'` and wait for `exit` events.
- Assert exit codes and, where feasible, assert on log output indicating shutdown was triggered.

**Verification**:
- Tests pass consistently on local and CI environments.
- No hanging child processes after tests complete.
- Behavior matches the master plan's signal-handling expectations.

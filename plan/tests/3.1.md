### Step 3.1: GET /health Endpoint
**Objective**: Test basic health check endpoint.

This task has been broken down into granular subtasks:

1. [TASK-3.1.1](./3.1.1.md): Test GET /health returns 200 with expected response
2. [TASK-3.1.2](./3.1.2.md): Test GET /health logs requester info

**Note**: Complete all subtasks in order (3.1.1 → 3.1.2). Each subtask is independently completable with its own Definition of Done.

**Original Tasks**:
1. Extend `tests/server.test.ts`:
   - Add test: `GET /health` returns 200 with `{ status: 'ok', service: 'cursor-runner' }`
   - Add test: `GET /health` logs requester info (IP, user-agent)
   - Use `supertest` to make HTTP requests

**Tests**:
- Use existing `supertest` setup from `server.test.ts`
- Verify response status and body shape
- Verify logger was called with expected metadata

**Verification**:
- Test passes
- Response matches expected contract
- Logging works correctly

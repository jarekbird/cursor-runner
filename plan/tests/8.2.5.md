# TASK-8.2.5: Test POST /telegram/webhook returns 200 even when internal error occurs

**Section**: 8. HTTP Server - Repository & Telegram Routes
**Subsection**: 8.2.5
**Task ID**: TASK-8.2.5
**Parent Task**: TASK-8.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `POST /telegram/webhook` returns 200 status code even when an internal error occurs, with `success: false` in the response. This ensures Telegram webhooks are always accepted to prevent retries.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /telegram/webhook endpoint, error handling)

## Current State

- POST /telegram/webhook endpoint exists
- Error handling exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for error handling may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies webhook resilience.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /telegram/webhook endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review error handling logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'POST /telegram/webhook returns 200 even when internal error occurs'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other /telegram/webhook tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock webhook handler to throw an error
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test endpoint with error
  - [ ] Create Telegram webhook payload
  - [ ] Make POST request to `/telegram/webhook` with payload
  - [ ] Verify response status is 200 (even though error occurred)
  - [ ] Verify response body contains `success: false`
  - [ ] Verify error is logged
- [ ] Step 4: Verify error handling
  - [ ] Assert response is 200 (not 500)
  - [ ] Assert response indicates failure with `success: false`
  - [ ] Assert error is logged for debugging

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Response is always 200
  - Acceptance: HTTP status code is 200 even when error occurs
  - Acceptance: Telegram webhook is accepted
- [ ] Requirement 2: Response indicates failure
  - Acceptance: Response body contains `success: false`
  - Acceptance: Error information is logged
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Different error types (verify all return 200)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining webhook resilience
- [ ] Document why webhooks always return 200

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify error handling works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 8: HTTP Server - Repository & Telegram Routes
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-8.2.4
- **Dependencies**: TASK-8.2.4, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Webhooks should always return 200 to prevent Telegram retries
  - Errors should be logged but not cause webhook failure
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-8.2.4

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-8.2.4
- Next: TASK-9.1.1
- Dependencies: TASK-8.2.4, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Error handling is verified (200 status with success: false)
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want webhooks to always return 200 so Telegram doesn't retry
- As a **system**, I want resilient webhooks so errors don't cause retry loops

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies 200 status even when error occurs
- Test verifies success: false in response
- Test passes
- All tests pass

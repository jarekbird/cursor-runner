### Step 10.4: CursorCLI - SSH Host Key Prompt
**Objective**: Test SSH prompt auto-response.

This task has been broken down into granular subtasks:

1. [TASK-10.4.1](./10.4.1.md): Test SSH host key prompt is detected in PTY output
2. [TASK-10.4.2](./10.4.2.md): Test write('yes\n') is called once when prompt detected
3. [TASK-10.4.3](./10.4.3.md): Test multiple prompts don't cause multiple responses

**Note**: Complete all subtasks in order (10.4.1 → 10.4.2 → 10.4.3). Each subtask is independently completable with its own Definition of Done.

**Original Tasks**:
1. Extend `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`:
   - Add test: SSH host key prompt is detected in PTY output
   - Add test: `write('yes\n')` is called once when prompt detected
   - Add test: Multiple prompts don't cause multiple responses
   - Mock PTY output to include SSH prompt text

**Tests**:
- Verify prompt detection
- Verify auto-response
- Verify no duplicate responses

**Verification**:
- Tests pass
- SSH handling works correctly

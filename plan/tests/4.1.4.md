# TASK-4.1.4: Test POST /cursor/execute returns 500 when execute() throws

**Section**: 4. HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
**Subsection**: 4.1.4
**Task ID**: TASK-4.1.4
**Parent Task**: TASK-4.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `POST /cursor/execute` returns 500 status code when `cursorExecution.execute()` throws an error. This ensures error handling works correctly for the execute endpoint.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /cursor/execute endpoint, error handling)

## Current State

- POST /cursor/execute endpoint exists
- Error handling exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for error handling may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies error handling for the execute endpoint.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /cursor/execute endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review error handling logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` and `assertErrorResponse()` helpers

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'POST /cursor/execute returns 500 when execute() throws'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other cursor/execute tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `cursorExecution.execute()` to throw an error
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test execute endpoint with error
  - [ ] Make POST request to `/cursor/execute` with test body
  - [ ] Verify response status is 500
  - [ ] Verify response body contains error information
- [ ] Step 4: Verify error response
  - [ ] Use `assertErrorResponse()` helper
  - [ ] Verify error message is included
  - [ ] Verify error response structure is correct

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Error returns 500 status
  - Acceptance: HTTP status code is 500 when execute() throws
  - Acceptance: Error is caught and handled
- [ ] Requirement 2: Error response is informative
  - Acceptance: Response contains error information
  - Acceptance: Error message is clear
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Mocks are properly cleaned up

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Different error types
  - Verify various error types are handled correctly
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: Error with stack trace
  - Verify stack trace is handled appropriately (may be logged, not in response)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify error handling works correctly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining error handling
- [ ] Document expected error response format

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify error handling is correct
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 4: HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-4.1.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-4.1.3, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.5
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Errors should be caught and returned as 500
  - Error messages should be informative but not expose internals
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-4.1.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-4.1.3
- Next: TASK-4.1.5
- Dependencies: TASK-4.1.3, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.5
- Related:
  - TASK-4.1: POST /cursor/execute (Synchronous) (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Error handling is verified (500 status)
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want proper error handling so I know when execution fails
- As a **client**, I want error responses so I can handle failures appropriately

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies 500 status when execute() throws
- Test verifies error response is informative
- Test passes
- All tests pass

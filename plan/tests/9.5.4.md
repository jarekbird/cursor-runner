# TASK-9.5.4: Test CursorExecutionService.iterate() maintains conversation across iterations

**Section**: 9. Execution Orchestration
**Subsection**: 9.5.4
**Task ID**: TASK-9.5.4
**Parent Task**: TASK-9.5

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorExecutionService.iterate()` maintains the same conversation across all iterations. This ensures conversation continuity during iteration.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (iterate method, conversation maintenance)

## Current State

- CursorExecutionService.iterate() exists
- Conversation maintenance exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for conversation maintenance may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies conversation continuity across iterations.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorExecutionService.iterate() implementation
- [ ] Review how conversation is maintained across iterations
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` and `createMockRedisClient()` helpers

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'iterate() maintains conversation across iterations'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other conversation integration tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `ConversationService.addMessage()` to track conversation ID usage
- [ ] Step 3: Test iterate() conversation maintenance
  - [ ] Call `iterate()` with maxIterations: 3
  - [ ] Verify all iterations use the same conversation ID
  - [ ] Verify ConversationService.addMessage() is called with same conversation ID for all iterations
  - [ ] Verify conversation ID doesn't change between iterations
- [ ] Step 4: Verify conversation maintenance
  - [ ] Assert same conversation ID is used across all iterations
  - [ ] Assert conversation ID doesn't change

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Conversation is maintained
  - Acceptance: Same conversation ID is used across all iterations
  - Acceptance: Conversation ID doesn't change
- [ ] Requirement 2: Messages are added to same conversation
  - Acceptance: All iteration messages are added to same conversation
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Single iteration (verify conversation is still maintained)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify conversation maintenance works correctly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining conversation maintenance

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify conversation maintenance works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 9: Execution Orchestration
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-9.5.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-9.5.3, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Conversation should remain consistent across iterations
  - All iteration messages should be in same conversation
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-9.5.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-9.5.3
- Next: TASK-10.1.1
- Dependencies: TASK-9.5.3, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-9.5: CursorExecutionService - Conversation Integration (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Conversation maintenance is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want conversation maintained so iteration messages are in same conversation
- As a **system**, I want conversation continuity so iteration context is preserved

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies conversation is maintained across iterations
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-2.2.5: Test initialize() calls validateGmailConfig()

**Section**: 2. Core Application Lifecycle
**Subsection**: 2.2.5
**Task ID**: TASK-2.2.5
**Parent Task**: TASK-2.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `initialize()` calls `validateGmailConfig()` during initialization. This ensures Gmail configuration is validated during startup.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/index.ts` (initialize method, validateGmailConfig method)

## Current State

- `initialize()` method exists
- `validateGmailConfig()` method exists
- `tests/index.test.ts` exists
- Test for validateGmailConfig call may not exist yet

**Important**: This verifies Gmail config validation happens during initialization.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `initialize()` implementation
- [ ] Review `validateGmailConfig()` method
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/index.test.ts`

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'initialize() calls validateGmailConfig()'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other initialize() tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Create CursorRunner instance
  - [ ] Use `jest.spyOn` to spy on `validateGmailConfig` method
  - [ ] Mock other dependencies
- [ ] Step 3: Test initialization
  - [ ] Call `initialize()` method
  - [ ] Verify `validateGmailConfig()` was called
  - [ ] Verify call happens in correct sequence
- [ ] Step 4: Verify call order
  - [ ] Assert validateGmailConfig is called after verifyMcpConfig
  - [ ] Assert it's called before cursorCLI.validate()

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: validateGmailConfig is called
  - Acceptance: Method is called during initialize
  - Acceptance: Call is verified via spy
- [ ] Requirement 2: Call order is correct
  - Acceptance: Called in correct position in sequence
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Mocks are properly cleaned up

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:unit`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining what is being tested

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify validateGmailConfig is called
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: Core Application Lifecycle
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-2.2.4
- **Dependencies**: TASK-2.2.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Gmail config validation details are tested in TASK-13.2
  - Focus on verifying call, not validation logic
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-2.2.4

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-2.2.4
- Next: TASK-2.2.6
- Dependencies: TASK-2.2.4
- Related:
  - TASK-2.2: CursorRunner.initialize() - Happy Path (parent task)
  - TASK-13.2: Gmail MCP Configuration (detailed tests)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/index.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. validateGmailConfig call is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want to verify Gmail config is validated so I know Gmail setup is checked
- As a **system**, I want Gmail config validated during startup so Gmail features work if configured

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies validateGmailConfig is called
- Test passes
- All tests pass

### Step 9.2: CursorExecutionService - System Instructions
**Objective**: Test system instructions are appended correctly.

This task has been broken down into granular subtasks:

1. [TASK-9.2.1](./9.2.1.md): Test execute() appends SYSTEM_SETTINGS_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS to non-review prompts
2. [TASK-9.2.2](./9.2.2.md): Test execute() does not duplicate system instructions across iterations
3. [TASK-9.2.3](./9.2.3.md): Test Review agent prompts do not include system instructions

**Note**: Complete all subtasks in order (9.2.1 → 9.2.2 → 9.2.3). Each subtask is independently completable with its own Definition of Done.

**Original Tasks**:
1. Extend `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`:
   - Add test: `execute()` appends `SYSTEM_SETTINGS_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS` to non-review prompts
   - Add test: `execute()` does not duplicate system instructions across iterations
   - Add test: Review agent prompts do not include system instructions
   - Mock `CommandParserService` and verify prompt construction

**Tests**:
- Verify instruction appending
- Verify no duplication
- Verify review agent exclusion

**Verification**:
- Tests pass
- Instructions are handled correctly

# TASK-4.4.2: Test POST /cursor/iterate/async logs callback URL source

**Section**: 4. HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
**Subsection**: 4.4.2
**Task ID**: TASK-4.4.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-4.4

## Description

Write a test to verify that `POST /cursor/iterate/async` logs the source of the callback URL (environment variable vs default) when processing the request. This ensures visibility into how the callback URL was determined.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /cursor/iterate/async endpoint, logging)

## Current State

- POST /cursor/iterate/async endpoint exists
- Logging exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for callback URL source logging may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies logging behavior for callback URL source.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /cursor/iterate/async endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review logging logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'POST /cursor/iterate/async logs callback URL source'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other cursor/iterate/async tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Set up logger spy to capture log messages
  - [ ] Set environment variables or mock buildCallbackUrl() to control URL source
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test async iterate endpoint with logging
  - [ ] Make POST request to `/cursor/iterate/async` with body (with and without callbackUrl)
  - [ ] Verify logger was called with callback URL source information
  - [ ] Verify log message indicates source (env var vs default vs provided)
- [ ] Step 4: Verify log content
  - [ ] Assert logger.info() or logger.debug() was called
  - [ ] Assert log message contains callback URL source
  - [ ] Test both cases: env var source and default source

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Callback URL source is logged
  - Acceptance: Logger is called with source information
  - Acceptance: Source is correctly identified
- [ ] Requirement 2: Log message is informative
  - Acceptance: Message indicates where callback URL came from
  - Acceptance: Message is clear and helpful
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Logger spy is properly cleaned up

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Multiple sources (env var and provided)
  - Verify which source is logged (provided should take precedence)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify callback URL source is logged
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining logging behavior
- [ ] Document expected log message format

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify logging works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 4: HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-4.4.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-4.4.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Logging should provide visibility into callback URL source
  - Helps with debugging callback issues
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-4.4.1

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-4.4.1
- Next: TASK-4.4.3
- Dependencies: TASK-4.4.1, TASK-1.1.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Callback URL source logging is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want to see callback URL source so I can debug callback issues
- As an **operator**, I want callback URL source logged so I know how URLs are determined

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies callback URL source is logged
- Test verifies log message indicates source
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-9.3.2: Test CursorExecutionService.execute() handles CommandError with stdout/stderr

**Section**: 9. Execution Orchestration
**Subsection**: 9.3.2
**Task ID**: TASK-9.3.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-9.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorExecutionService.execute()` handles `CommandError` exceptions with stdout and stderr attached. This ensures command errors are properly handled and returned.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (execute method, CommandError handling), `src/cursor-cli.ts` (CommandError class)

## Current State

- CursorExecutionService.execute() exists
- CommandError handling exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for CommandError handling may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies CommandError handling.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorExecutionService.execute() implementation
- [ ] Review CommandError class structure
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` and `createMockCursorCLI()` helpers

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'execute() handles CommandError with stdout/stderr'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other execution flow tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `CursorCLI.executeCommand()` to throw CommandError with stdout and stderr
- [ ] Step 3: Test execute() with CommandError
  - [ ] Call `execute()` with test request
  - [ ] Verify error response is returned
  - [ ] Verify error response includes stdout and stderr from CommandError
  - [ ] Verify error response structure matches expected format
- [ ] Step 4: Verify error response
  - [ ] Assert error response includes stdout
  - [ ] Assert error response includes stderr
  - [ ] Assert error response structure is correct

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: CommandError is handled
  - Acceptance: Error response is returned when CommandError is thrown
  - Acceptance: Error response includes stdout and stderr
- [ ] Requirement 2: Error response structure is correct
  - Acceptance: Response structure matches expected format
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: CommandError with empty stdout/stderr (verify handling)
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: CommandError with very long stdout/stderr (verify truncation if applicable)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining CommandError handling

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify CommandError handling works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 9: Execution Orchestration
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-9.3.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-9.3.1, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - CommandError should include stdout and stderr
  - Error response should preserve this information
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-9.3.1

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-9.3.1
- Next: TASK-9.3.3
- Dependencies: TASK-9.3.1, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-9.3: CursorExecutionService - Execution Flows (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. CommandError handling is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want CommandError handling so I can see command output when errors occur
- As a **client**, I want error details so I can debug command failures

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies CommandError is handled with stdout/stderr
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-4.5.3: Test POST /cursor/conversation/new returns conversation ID

**Section**: 4. HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
**Subsection**: 4.5.3
**Task ID**: TASK-4.5.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-4.5

## Description

Write a test to verify that `POST /cursor/conversation/new` returns the conversation ID in the response. This ensures clients can use the conversation ID for subsequent requests.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /cursor/conversation/new endpoint)

## Current State

- POST /cursor/conversation/new endpoint exists
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for conversation ID response may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies response contains conversation ID.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /cursor/conversation/new endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'POST /cursor/conversation/new returns conversation ID'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other cursor/conversation/new tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `conversationService.forceNewConversation()` to return test conversation ID: 'test-conversation-id'
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test conversation creation endpoint
  - [ ] Make POST request to `/cursor/conversation/new` with test body
  - [ ] Verify response status is 200
  - [ ] Verify response body contains conversation ID
  - [ ] Verify conversation ID matches mocked return value
- [ ] Step 4: Verify response structure
  - [ ] Use `assertSuccessResponse()` helper
  - [ ] Verify conversation ID field exists
  - [ ] Verify conversation ID format is correct (UUID or similar)

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Conversation ID is returned
  - Acceptance: Response contains conversation ID field
  - Acceptance: Conversation ID matches forceNewConversation() return value
- [ ] Requirement 2: Response status is 200
  - Acceptance: HTTP status code is 200
  - Acceptance: Response is successful
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Mocks are properly cleaned up

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Conversation ID format
  - Verify ID format is consistent

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify conversation ID is returned correctly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining response format
- [ ] Document conversation ID format

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify conversation ID is returned correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 4: HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-4.5.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-4.5.2, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Conversation ID should be in a consistent format
  - ID should be usable for subsequent requests
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-4.5.2

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-4.5.2
- Next: TASK-5.1.1
- Dependencies: TASK-4.5.2, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Conversation ID response is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want conversation ID returned so I can use it for subsequent requests
- As a **client**, I want conversation ID so I can track and reference conversations

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies conversation ID is returned
- Test verifies ID format is correct
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-2.1.2: Test validateConfig throws when CURSOR_CLI_PATH is missing

**Section**: 2. Core Application Lifecycle
**Subsection**: 2.1.2
**Task ID**: TASK-2.1.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-2.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `validateConfig()` throws an error when the required `CURSOR_CLI_PATH` environment variable is missing. This ensures proper configuration validation.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/index.ts` (validateConfig method)

## Current State

- `validateConfig()` method exists in CursorRunner
- `tests/index.test.ts` exists
- Test for missing CURSOR_CLI_PATH may not exist yet

**Important**: This test ensures configuration validation works correctly.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `validateConfig()` implementation
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Understand how env vars are accessed in tests

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'validateConfig throws when CURSOR_CLI_PATH is missing'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for validateConfig tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test environment
  - [ ] Use `beforeEach` to save original env var value
  - [ ] Delete `CURSOR_CLI_PATH` from `process.env`
  - [ ] Use `afterEach` to restore original env var
- [ ] Step 3: Test validation
  - [ ] Create CursorRunner instance (or call validateConfig directly)
  - [ ] Verify error is thrown
  - [ ] Verify error message is descriptive and actionable
- [ ] Step 4: Verify error message
  - [ ] Assert error message mentions CURSOR_CLI_PATH
  - [ ] Assert error message is helpful for debugging

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Error is thrown when CURSOR_CLI_PATH is missing
  - Acceptance: Test fails if error is not thrown
  - Acceptance: Error is thrown synchronously or promise is rejected
- [ ] Requirement 2: Error message is descriptive
  - Acceptance: Error message clearly indicates missing env var
  - Acceptance: Error message suggests how to fix the issue
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Env var is restored after test

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: CURSOR_CLI_PATH is empty string
  - Verify empty string is treated as missing (if applicable)
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: CURSOR_CLI_PATH is undefined vs not set
  - Verify both cases are handled correctly

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:unit`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining what is being tested
- [ ] Document expected error message format

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify error message is helpful
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests
- [ ] Verify test is maintainable

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: Core Application Lifecycle
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-2.1.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-2.1.1
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Must properly clean up env vars to avoid test pollution
  - Error message should be actionable
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-2.1.1

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/index.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Error message is verified to be descriptive
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want to know when CURSOR_CLI_PATH is missing so I can fix configuration issues quickly
- As a **system**, I want validation to fail fast when required config is missing so I don't start in a broken state

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies error is thrown when CURSOR_CLI_PATH is missing
- Test verifies error message is descriptive
- Test passes
- All tests pass

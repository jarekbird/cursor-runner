# TASK-13.1.1: Test isSystemSettingEnabled() reads from DB when available

**Section**: 13. System Settings, Gmail MCP, Feature Flags
**Subsection**: 13.1.1
**Task ID**: TASK-13.1.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-13.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `isSystemSettingEnabled()` reads the setting value from the database when the database is available. This ensures database reading works correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/system-settings.ts` (isSystemSettingEnabled method, DB reading)

## Current State

- SystemSettings.isSystemSettingEnabled() exists
- Database reading exists
- `tests/system-settings.test.ts` exists (or needs to be created)
- Test for DB reading may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies database reading functionality.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review SystemSettings.isSystemSettingEnabled() implementation
- [ ] Review database reading logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/system-settings.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createTempSqliteDb()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'isSystemSettingEnabled() reads from DB when available'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for SystemSettings database reading tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test database
  - [ ] Use `createTempSqliteDb()` helper
  - [ ] Insert test system setting in database (e.g., 'debug' = true)
- [ ] Step 3: Test isSystemSettingEnabled() with DB available
  - [ ] Call `isSystemSettingEnabled('debug')` with DB available
  - [ ] Verify value is read from database
  - [ ] Verify returned value matches database value
- [ ] Step 4: Verify DB reading
  - [ ] Assert value is read from database
  - [ ] Assert value matches database value

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Value is read from DB
  - Acceptance: Database is queried for setting
  - Acceptance: Value from database is returned
- [ ] Requirement 2: Reading is correct
  - Acceptance: Returned value matches database value
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Setting doesn't exist in DB (verify returns false)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/system-settings.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining DB reading

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify DB reading works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 13: System Settings, Gmail MCP, Feature Flags
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-12.3.5
- **Dependencies**: TASK-12.3.5, TASK-1.1.2
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Database should be primary source for settings
  - Use temp SQLite DB for testing
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-12.3.5

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/system-settings.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. DB reading is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want DB reading so settings are stored persistently
- As a **system**, I want DB reading so settings are reliable

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies value is read from database
- Test passes
- All tests pass

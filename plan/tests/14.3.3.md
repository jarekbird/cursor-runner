# TASK-14.3.3: Test TerminalService streaming works correctly

**Section**: 14. Filesystem & Workspace Services
**Subsection**: 14.3.3
**Task ID**: TASK-14.3.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-14.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `TerminalService` streaming functionality works correctly - output is streamed in real-time as it's produced. This ensures streaming behavior is correct.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/terminal-service.ts` (streaming logic)

## Current State

- TerminalService exists
- Streaming logic exists
- `tests/terminal-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for streaming may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies streaming functionality.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review TerminalService implementation
- [ ] Review streaming logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/terminal-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use child process and stream mocking

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'Streaming works correctly'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other TerminalService tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Mock child process with stream
  - [ ] Set up stream event handlers
- [ ] Step 3: Test streaming
  - [ ] Create TerminalService instance and start streaming operation
  - [ ] Simulate stream data chunks
  - [ ] Verify data chunks are received in order
  - [ ] Verify streaming completes correctly
- [ ] Step 4: Verify streaming
  - [ ] Assert data is streamed correctly
  - [ ] Assert streaming order is preserved

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Streaming works
  - Acceptance: Data is streamed as it's produced
  - Acceptance: Streaming order is correct
- [ ] Requirement 2: Streaming is complete
  - Acceptance: All data is streamed
  - Acceptance: Streaming completes properly
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Large stream data (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/terminal-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining streaming behavior

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify streaming works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 14: Filesystem & Workspace Services
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-14.3.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-14.3.2
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Streaming should be real-time
  - Order should be preserved
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-14.3.2

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/terminal-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Streaming is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want streaming so I can see output in real-time
- As a **client**, I want streaming so I can monitor progress

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies streaming works correctly
- Test passes
- All tests pass

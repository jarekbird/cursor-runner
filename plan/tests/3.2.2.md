# TASK-3.2.2: Test GET /health/queue includes warning when queue is full

**Section**: 3. HTTP Server - Health & Diagnostics
**Subsection**: 3.2.2
**Task ID**: TASK-3.2.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-3.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `GET /health/queue` includes a `warning` field when `available === 0 && waiting > 0`. This ensures the endpoint alerts when the queue is full and requests are waiting.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (health/queue endpoint, warning logic)

## Current State

- Health/queue endpoint exists
- Warning logic exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for warning field may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies warning logic when queue is full.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review health/queue endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review warning logic (when available === 0 && waiting > 0)
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` and `createMockCursorCLI()` helpers

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'GET /health/queue includes warning when queue is full'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other health/queue tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `getQueueStatus()` to return: `{ available: 0, waiting: 3, maxConcurrent: 5 }`
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test queue endpoint with warning
  - [ ] Make GET request to `/health/queue`
  - [ ] Verify response status is 200
  - [ ] Verify response includes `warning` field
  - [ ] Verify warning field contains appropriate message
- [ ] Step 4: Verify warning content
  - [ ] Assert warning field exists
  - [ ] Assert warning message is informative
  - [ ] Assert warning indicates queue is full

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Warning field is present when queue is full
  - Acceptance: Response includes `warning` field when available === 0 && waiting > 0
  - Acceptance: Warning field is not present when queue is healthy
- [ ] Requirement 2: Warning message is informative
  - Acceptance: Warning message indicates queue is full
  - Acceptance: Warning message suggests action (if applicable)
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Mocks are properly cleaned up

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: available === 0 && waiting === 0
  - Verify no warning (queue is empty, not full)
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: available > 0 && waiting > 0
  - Verify no warning (queue has capacity)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify warning field is present when queue is full
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining warning logic
- [ ] Document when warning should appear

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify warning logic is correct
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 3: HTTP Server - Health & Diagnostics
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-3.2.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-3.2.1, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Warning should only appear when queue is truly full (available === 0 && waiting > 0)
  - Warning message should be actionable
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-3.2.1

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-3.2.1
- Next: TASK-3.2.3
- Dependencies: TASK-3.2.1, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Warning field is verified when queue is full
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want a warning when queue is full so I know requests are waiting
- As a **monitoring system**, I want queue warnings so I can alert operators

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies warning field is present when available === 0 && waiting > 0
- Test verifies warning message is informative
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-10.4.1: Test CursorCLI SSH host key prompt is detected in PTY output

**Section**: 10. CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
**Subsection**: 10.4.1
**Task ID**: TASK-10.4.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-10.4

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorCLI.executeCommand()` detects SSH host key prompts in PTY output. This ensures SSH prompts are recognized for auto-response.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-cli.ts` (executeCommand method, SSH prompt detection)

## Current State

- CursorCLI.executeCommand() exists
- SSH prompt detection exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts` exists
- Test for SSH prompt detection may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies SSH prompt detection.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorCLI.executeCommand() implementation
- [ ] Review SSH prompt detection logic
- [ ] Review SSH prompt text patterns
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'SSH host key prompt is detected in PTY output'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for CursorCLI SSH Host Key Prompt tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper
  - [ ] Mock PTY to emit output containing SSH prompt text
  - [ ] Track prompt detection
- [ ] Step 3: Test SSH prompt detection
  - [ ] Call `executeCommand()` with SSH command
  - [ ] Simulate PTY output containing SSH host key prompt
  - [ ] Verify prompt is detected
  - [ ] Verify detection logic works correctly
- [ ] Step 4: Verify prompt detection
  - [ ] Assert prompt is detected in output
  - [ ] Assert detection works for various prompt formats

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Prompt is detected
  - Acceptance: SSH prompt is detected in PTY output
  - Acceptance: Detection works for common prompt formats
- [ ] Requirement 2: Detection is reliable
  - Acceptance: Detection works consistently
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Prompt text appears in non-prompt context (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining SSH prompt detection

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify prompt detection works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 10: CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-10.3.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-10.3.3, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - SSH prompts should be detected reliably
  - Detection should work for various prompt formats
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-10.3.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-10.3.3
- Next: TASK-10.4.2
- Dependencies: TASK-10.3.3, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-10.4: CursorCLI - SSH Host Key Prompt (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. SSH prompt detection is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want SSH prompts detected so they can be auto-responded
- As a **system**, I want prompt detection so SSH connections work automatically

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies SSH prompt is detected in PTY output
- Test passes
- All tests pass

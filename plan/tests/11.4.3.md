# TASK-11.4.3: Test AgentConversationService.getConversation() backfills conversationId for old data

**Section**: 11. Redis-based Conversation Services
**Subsection**: 11.4.3
**Task ID**: TASK-11.4.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-11.4

## Description

Write a test to verify that `AgentConversationService.getConversation()` backfills `conversationId` for old data that doesn't have this field. This ensures backward compatibility with existing conversations.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/agent-conversation-service.ts` (getConversation method, conversationId backfill)

## Current State

- AgentConversationService.getConversation() exists
- conversationId backfill exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/agent-conversation-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for conversationId backfill may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies backward compatibility.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review AgentConversationService.getConversation() implementation
- [ ] Review conversationId backfill logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/agent-conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'getConversation() backfills conversationId for old data'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other basic operations tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test data
  - [ ] Create test conversation in Redis mock without conversationId field (old format)
- [ ] Step 3: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper
  - [ ] Mock Redis to return old-format conversation (no conversationId)
  - [ ] Track Redis update operations
- [ ] Step 4: Test conversationId backfill
  - [ ] Call `getConversation()` with test conversation ID
  - [ ] Verify conversationId is generated and added
  - [ ] Verify conversation is updated in Redis with conversationId
  - [ ] Verify returned conversation includes conversationId
- [ ] Step 5: Verify backfill
  - [ ] Assert conversationId is generated
  - [ ] Assert conversation is updated in Redis
  - [ ] Assert returned conversation has conversationId

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: conversationId is backfilled
  - Acceptance: conversationId is generated for old data
  - Acceptance: conversationId is added to conversation
- [ ] Requirement 2: Conversation is updated
  - Acceptance: Conversation is updated in Redis with conversationId
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Conversation already has conversationId (verify no backfill)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/agent-conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining conversationId backfill

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify backfill works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 11: Redis-based Conversation Services
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-11.4.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-11.4.2, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Backfill ensures backward compatibility
  - Old conversations should be updated with conversationId
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-11.4.2

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-11.4.2
- Next: TASK-11.4.4
- Dependencies: TASK-11.4.2, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-11.4: AgentConversationService - Basic Operations (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/agent-conversation-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. conversationId backfill is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want conversationId backfilled so old conversations are compatible
- As a **system**, I want backward compatibility so existing data works correctly

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies conversationId is backfilled for old data
- Test passes
- All tests pass

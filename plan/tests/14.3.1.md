# TASK-14.3.1: Test TerminalService resources are cleaned up on completion

**Section**: 14. Filesystem & Workspace Services
**Subsection**: 14.3.1
**Task ID**: TASK-14.3.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-14.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `TerminalService` resources (processes, streams, etc.) are cleaned up when operations complete. This ensures no resource leaks occur.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/terminal-service.ts` (cleanup logic)

## Current State

- TerminalService exists
- Cleanup logic exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/terminal-service.test.ts` exists (or needs to be created)
- Test for resource cleanup may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies resource cleanup.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review TerminalService implementation
- [ ] Review cleanup logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/terminal-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use child process mocking

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'Resources are cleaned up on completion'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for TerminalService cleanup tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Mock child process operations
  - [ ] Track resource creation and cleanup
- [ ] Step 3: Test resource cleanup
  - [ ] Create TerminalService instance and start operation
  - [ ] Complete operation
  - [ ] Verify cleanup methods are called
  - [ ] Verify resources are released
- [ ] Step 4: Verify cleanup
  - [ ] Assert cleanup methods are called
  - [ ] Assert resources are released

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Resources are cleaned up
  - Acceptance: Cleanup methods are called on completion
  - Acceptance: Resources are released
- [ ] Requirement 2: Cleanup is complete
  - Acceptance: All resources are cleaned up
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Operation fails (verify cleanup still occurs)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/terminal-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining cleanup behavior

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify resource cleanup works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 14: Filesystem & Workspace Services
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-14.2.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-14.2.3
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Cleanup should happen on both success and failure
  - Should prevent resource leaks
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-14.2.3

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/terminal-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Resource cleanup is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want resource cleanup so no leaks occur
- As a **system**, I want cleanup so resources are freed properly

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies resources are cleaned up on completion
- Test passes
- All tests pass

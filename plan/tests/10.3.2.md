# TASK-10.3.2: Test CursorCLI falls back to spawn when PTY fails

**Section**: 10. CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
**Subsection**: 10.3.2
**Task ID**: TASK-10.3.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-10.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorCLI.executeCommand()` falls back to spawn when PTY creation fails. This ensures graceful fallback behavior.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-cli.ts` (executeCommand method, PTY fallback)

## Current State

- CursorCLI.executeCommand() exists
- PTY fallback exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts` exists
- Test for PTY fallback may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies fallback behavior.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorCLI.executeCommand() implementation
- [ ] Review how PTY failure is handled
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'falls back to spawn when PTY fails'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other PTY tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `node-pty` module to be available
  - [ ] Mock PTY creation to throw error or fail
  - [ ] Mock spawn to track usage
- [ ] Step 3: Test fallback behavior
  - [ ] Call `executeCommand()` with test command
  - [ ] Verify PTY creation fails
  - [ ] Verify spawn is used as fallback
  - [ ] Verify command executes successfully with spawn
- [ ] Step 4: Verify fallback
  - [ ] Assert spawn is used when PTY fails
  - [ ] Assert command still executes successfully

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Fallback to spawn
  - Acceptance: spawn is used when PTY fails
  - Acceptance: Command executes successfully
- [ ] Requirement 2: Fallback is graceful
  - Acceptance: No error is thrown (fallback is transparent)
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: PTY fails after initial success (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining fallback behavior

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify fallback works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 10: CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-10.3.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-10.3.1, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Fallback should be transparent
  - Command should still execute successfully
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-10.3.1

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Fallback behavior is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want fallback to spawn so commands still work when PTY fails
- As a **system**, I want graceful fallback so execution is reliable

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies fallback to spawn when PTY fails
- Test passes
- All tests pass

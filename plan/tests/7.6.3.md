# TASK-7.6.3: Test DELETE /api/tasks/:id returns 200 with success message when deleted

**Section**: 7. HTTP Server - Tasks API
**Subsection**: 7.6.3
**Task ID**: TASK-7.6.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-7.6

## Description

Write a test to verify that `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` returns 200 status code with a success message when the task is successfully deleted. This ensures deletion works correctly and provides feedback.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (DELETE /api/tasks/:id endpoint), `src/task-service.ts` (deleteTask method)

## Current State

- DELETE /api/tasks/:id endpoint exists
- TaskService.deleteTask() exists
- `tests/tasks-api.test.ts` exists
- Test for successful deletion may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies successful deletion functionality.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review DELETE /api/tasks/:id endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review TaskService.deleteTask() method
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/tasks-api.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'DELETE /api/tasks/:id returns 200 with success message when deleted'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other /api/tasks/:id DELETE tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test data
  - [ ] Create a test task in database
  - [ ] Store task ID for deletion
- [ ] Step 3: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 4: Test endpoint
  - [ ] Make DELETE request to `/api/tasks/{taskId}`
  - [ ] Verify response status is 200
  - [ ] Verify response body contains success message
  - [ ] Query database to verify task was deleted
- [ ] Step 5: Verify deletion
  - [ ] Assert task no longer exists in database
  - [ ] Assert response indicates success
  - [ ] Use `assertSuccessResponse()` helper

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Response status is 200
  - Acceptance: HTTP status code is 200
  - Acceptance: Response indicates success
- [ ] Requirement 2: Task is deleted
  - Acceptance: Task no longer exists in database
  - Acceptance: Deletion is permanent
- [ ] Requirement 3: Success message is included
  - Acceptance: Response contains success message
  - Acceptance: Message is clear
- [ ] Requirement 4: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Task already deleted (should return 404, not 200)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/tasks-api.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify deletion works correctly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining deletion behavior

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify deletion works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 7: HTTP Server - Tasks API
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-7.6.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-7.6.2, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Deletion should be permanent
  - Use real database for integration test
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-7.6.2

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-7.6.2
- Next: TASK-8.1.1
- Dependencies: TASK-7.6.2, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6

  - TASK-7.6: DELETE /api/tasks/:id (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/tasks-api.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Deletion is verified
4. Success message is verified
5. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
6. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
7. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want to delete tasks so I can remove completed tasks
- As a **client**, I want success messages so I know deletion succeeded

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies 200 status when task is deleted
- Test verifies task is removed from database
- Test verifies success message is returned
- Test passes
- All tests pass

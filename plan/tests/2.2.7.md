# TASK-2.2.7: Test initialize() calls server.start()

**Section**: 2. Core Application Lifecycle
**Subsection**: 2.2.7
**Task ID**: TASK-2.2.7
**Parent Task**: TASK-2.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `initialize()` calls `server.start()` as the final step in the initialization sequence. This ensures the HTTP server is started after all other initialization steps complete.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/index.ts` (initialize method), `src/server.ts` (Server.start method)

## Current State

- `initialize()` method exists
- `Server.start()` method exists
- `tests/index.test.ts` exists
- Test for server.start call may not exist yet

**Important**: This verifies the server starts after all initialization steps complete.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `initialize()` implementation
- [ ] Review `Server.start()` method
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper from Phase 1.1

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'initialize() calls server.start()'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other initialize() tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Create CursorRunner instance with mocked server
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper or `jest.spyOn` on start method
  - [ ] Mock all other dependencies
- [ ] Step 3: Test initialization
  - [ ] Call `initialize()` method
  - [ ] Verify `server.start()` was called
  - [ ] Verify call happens last in sequence
- [ ] Step 4: Verify call order
  - [ ] Assert server.start is called after all other initialization steps
  - [ ] Assert it's the last call in the sequence

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: server.start is called
  - Acceptance: Method is called during initialize
  - Acceptance: Call is verified via spy or mock
- [ ] Requirement 2: Call order is correct
  - Acceptance: Called last in initialization sequence
  - Acceptance: Called after all validation and setup steps
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Mocks are properly cleaned up

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: server.start throws
  - Verify initialize handles server errors (may be separate test)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:unit`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining what is being tested
- [ ] Document that server.start should be last

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify server.start is called
- [ ] Verify call order is correct (last in sequence)
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: Core Application Lifecycle
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-2.2.6
- **Dependencies**: TASK-2.2.6, TASK-1.1.4 (createMockServer helper)
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Server should start last, after all validation
  - Focus on verifying call and order
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-2.2.6

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-2.2.6
- Next: TASK-2.2.8
- Dependencies: TASK-2.2.6, TASK-1.1.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/index.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. server.start call is verified
4. Call order is verified (last in sequence)
5. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
6. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
7. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want to verify server starts so I know HTTP endpoints are available after init
- As a **system**, I want server to start last so all dependencies are ready before accepting requests

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies server.start is called
- Test verifies it's called last
- Test passes
- All tests pass

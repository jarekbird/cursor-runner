# TASK-11.5.2: Test AgentConversationService.listConversations() sorts by lastAccessedAt asc/desc

**Section**: 11. Redis-based Conversation Services
**Subsection**: 11.5.2
**Task ID**: TASK-11.5.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-11.5

## Description

Write a test to verify that `AgentConversationService.listConversations()` sorts conversations by `lastAccessedAt` in ascending and descending order.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/agent-conversation-service.ts` (listConversations method, sorting)

## Current State

- AgentConversationService.listConversations() exists
- Sorting exists
- `tests/agent-conversation-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for lastAccessedAt sorting may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies sorting by lastAccessedAt.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review AgentConversationService.listConversations() implementation
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/agent-conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'listConversations() sorts by lastAccessedAt asc/desc'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other sorting tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test data
  - [ ] Create multiple test conversations with different lastAccessedAt timestamps
- [ ] Step 3: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper
  - [ ] Mock Redis to return test conversations
- [ ] Step 4: Test sorting
  - [ ] Test case 1: Call `listConversations()` with sortBy: 'lastAccessedAt', sortOrder: 'asc'
  - [ ] Verify conversations are sorted by lastAccessedAt ascending
  - [ ] Test case 2: Call `listConversations()` with sortBy: 'lastAccessedAt', sortOrder: 'desc'
  - [ ] Verify conversations are sorted by lastAccessedAt descending
- [ ] Step 5: Verify sorting
  - [ ] Assert ascending sort is correct
  - [ ] Assert descending sort is correct

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Sorting works
  - Acceptance: Conversations are sorted by lastAccessedAt
  - Acceptance: Ascending and descending both work
- [ ] Requirement 2: Sort order is correct
  - Acceptance: Ascending: least recently accessed first
  - Acceptance: Descending: most recently accessed first
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/agent-conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining sorting

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify sorting works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 11: Redis-based Conversation Services
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-11.5.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-11.5.1, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Sorting should work for both asc and desc
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-11.5.1

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-11.5.1
- Next: TASK-11.5.3
- Dependencies: TASK-11.5.1, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/agent-conversation-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Sorting by lastAccessedAt is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want sorting by lastAccessedAt so I can order by access time
- As a **client**, I want sorting so I can see recently accessed conversations

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies sorting by lastAccessedAt asc/desc
- Test passes
- All tests pass

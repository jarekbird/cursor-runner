# TASK-4.1.3: Test POST /cursor/execute detects queueType from requestId

**Section**: 4. HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
**Subsection**: 4.1.3
**Task ID**: TASK-4.1.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-4.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `POST /cursor/execute` detects `queueType` from `requestId` when the `telegram-` prefix is present. This ensures automatic queue type detection works for Telegram requests.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /cursor/execute endpoint, requestId queueType detection)

## Current State

- POST /cursor/execute endpoint exists
- requestId queueType detection exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for requestId queueType detection may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies implicit queueType detection from requestId.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /cursor/execute endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review how requestId is parsed for queueType detection
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'POST /cursor/execute detects queueType from requestId when telegram- prefix present'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other cursor/execute tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `cursorExecution.execute()` to track queueType parameter
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test execute endpoint with telegram requestId
  - [ ] Make POST request to `/cursor/execute` with body: `{ prompt: 'test', requestId: 'telegram-12345' }`
  - [ ] Verify execute() was called with queueType: 'telegram'
  - [ ] Verify response is successful
- [ ] Step 4: Verify queueType detection
  - [ ] Assert execute() receives queueType: 'telegram'
  - [ ] Assert queueType is detected from requestId prefix
  - [ ] Test with other prefixes if applicable (e.g., 'api-', 'webhook-')

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: queueType is detected from requestId
  - Acceptance: execute() is called with queueType: 'telegram' when requestId starts with 'telegram-'
  - Acceptance: Detection works correctly
- [ ] Requirement 2: Detection takes precedence over body queueType (if both present)
  - Acceptance: requestId detection overrides body queueType (if that's the expected behavior)
  - Acceptance: Or body queueType takes precedence (verify expected behavior)
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Mocks are properly cleaned up

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: requestId without prefix
  - Verify default queueType is used
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: requestId with unknown prefix
  - Verify default queueType is used
- [ ] Handle edge case 3: requestId and body queueType both present
  - Verify which takes precedence

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify queueType detection works correctly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining queueType detection logic
- [ ] Document requestId prefix patterns

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify queueType detection is correct
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 4: HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-4.1.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-4.1.2, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - requestId prefix detection provides automatic queue type assignment
  - Should handle various prefix patterns
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-4.1.2

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-4.1.2
- Next: TASK-4.1.4
- Dependencies: TASK-4.1.2, TASK-1.1.4
- Related:
  - TASK-4.1: POST /cursor/execute (Synchronous) (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. queueType detection from requestId is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want automatic queueType detection so I don't have to specify it explicitly
- As a **system**, I want queueType from requestId so Telegram requests are automatically routed correctly

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies queueType is detected from requestId prefix
- Test verifies detection works for 'telegram-' prefix
- Test passes
- All tests pass

### Step 7.1: Tasks API Test Infrastructure
**Objective**: Set up test infrastructure for Tasks API.

This task has been broken down into granular subtasks:

1. [TASK-7.1.1](./7.1.1.md): Set up Tasks API test infrastructure with temp SQLite DB

**Note**: This is a single infrastructure setup task. Complete it before all other Phase 7 tasks.

**Original Tasks**:
1. Create `tests/tasks-api.test.ts`:
   - Set up `beforeAll` to create temp SQLite DB and run migrations
   - Set up `afterAll` to clean up temp DB
   - Set `process.env.SHARED_DB_PATH` to temp DB path
   - Create helper to reset DB state between tests

**Tests**:
- Verify temp DB is created
- Verify migrations run successfully
- Verify cleanup works

**Verification**:
- Test infrastructure is ready
- No leaks between tests

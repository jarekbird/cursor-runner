# TASK-11.3.2: Test ConversationService.addMessage() skips review-agent messages when debug disabled

**Section**: 11. Redis-based Conversation Services
**Subsection**: 11.3.2
**Task ID**: TASK-11.3.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-11.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `ConversationService.addMessage()` skips review-agent messages when debug is disabled. This ensures review-agent messages are excluded from storage when debug is off.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/conversation-service.ts` (addMessage method, debug flag handling)

## Current State

- ConversationService.addMessage() exists
- Debug flag handling exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/conversation-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for review-agent exclusion may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies review-agent message exclusion.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review ConversationService.addMessage() implementation
- [ ] Review how review-agent messages are identified
- [ ] Review debug flag checking
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'addMessage() skips review-agent messages when debug disabled'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other message storage tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `isSystemSettingEnabled('debug')` to return false
  - [ ] Track Redis operations
- [ ] Step 3: Test review-agent exclusion
  - [ ] Call `addMessage()` with review-agent message (identify how review-agent is detected)
  - [ ] Verify message is NOT stored in Redis
  - [ ] Verify no Redis operations are performed for review-agent message
- [ ] Step 4: Verify exclusion
  - [ ] Assert review-agent message is not stored
  - [ ] Assert Redis operations are skipped

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Review-agent messages are skipped
  - Acceptance: Review-agent messages are not stored when debug is disabled
  - Acceptance: No Redis operations are performed
- [ ] Requirement 2: Exclusion is correct
  - Acceptance: Only review-agent messages are excluded
  - Acceptance: Other messages are still stored
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Review-agent message with debug enabled (verify it is stored)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining review-agent exclusion

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify review-agent exclusion works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 11: Redis-based Conversation Services
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-11.3.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-11.3.1, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Review-agent messages should be excluded when debug is disabled
  - This reduces storage and improves performance
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-11.3.1

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-11.3.1
- Next: TASK-11.3.3
- Dependencies: TASK-11.3.1, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Review-agent exclusion is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want review-agent messages excluded so storage is more efficient
- As a **system**, I want exclusion so I don't store unnecessary messages

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies review-agent messages are skipped when debug disabled
- Test passes
- All tests pass

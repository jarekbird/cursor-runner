# TASK-8.2.4: Test POST /telegram/webhook handles unknown update type

**Section**: 8. HTTP Server - Repository & Telegram Routes
**Subsection**: 8.2.4
**Task ID**: TASK-8.2.4
**Parent Task**: TASK-8.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `POST /telegram/webhook` handles unknown update types gracefully. This ensures the webhook doesn't crash on unsupported update types.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /telegram/webhook endpoint, unknown update handling)

## Current State

- POST /telegram/webhook endpoint exists
- Unknown update handling exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for unknown update type may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies graceful handling of unknown updates.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /telegram/webhook endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review how unknown updates are handled
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'POST /telegram/webhook handles unknown update type'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other /telegram/webhook tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test endpoint with unknown update
  - [ ] Create Telegram webhook payload with unknown update type (e.g., `poll`, `channel_post`)
  - [ ] Make POST request to `/telegram/webhook` with payload
  - [ ] Verify response status is 200 (webhook should accept but ignore)
  - [ ] Verify no error is thrown
  - [ ] Verify system continues to operate normally
- [ ] Step 4: Verify graceful handling
  - [ ] Assert response is successful
  - [ ] Assert no exception is thrown
  - [ ] Assert unknown update is logged (if applicable)

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Unknown update is handled gracefully
  - Acceptance: Response status is 200 (webhook accepted)
  - Acceptance: No exception is thrown
- [ ] Requirement 2: System continues operating
  - Acceptance: System doesn't crash
  - Acceptance: Other updates can still be processed
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Update with no type field (verify handling)
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: Malformed update payload (verify error handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining unknown update handling

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify graceful handling works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 8: HTTP Server - Repository & Telegram Routes
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-8.2.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-8.2.3, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Unknown updates should be accepted but ignored
  - System should not crash on unknown types
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-8.2.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-8.2.3
- Next: TASK-9.1.1
- Dependencies: TASK-8.2.3, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Graceful handling is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want unknown updates handled gracefully so the system doesn't crash
- As a **system**, I want to accept all webhooks so Telegram doesn't retry

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies unknown update type is handled gracefully
- Test verifies system doesn't crash
- Test passes
- All tests pass

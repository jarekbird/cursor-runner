# TASK-10.4.2: Test CursorCLI write('yes\n') is called once when SSH prompt detected

**Section**: 10. CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
**Subsection**: 10.4.2
**Task ID**: TASK-10.4.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-10.4

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorCLI.executeCommand()` calls `write('yes\n')` exactly once when an SSH host key prompt is detected. This ensures auto-response works correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-cli.ts` (executeCommand method, SSH prompt auto-response)

## Current State

- CursorCLI.executeCommand() exists
- SSH prompt auto-response exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts` exists
- Test for auto-response may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies SSH prompt auto-response.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorCLI.executeCommand() implementation
- [ ] Review SSH prompt auto-response logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'write("yes\\n") is called once when SSH prompt detected'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other SSH prompt tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper
  - [ ] Mock PTY to emit output containing SSH prompt
  - [ ] Track write() calls on PTY
- [ ] Step 3: Test auto-response
  - [ ] Call `executeCommand()` with SSH command
  - [ ] Simulate PTY output containing SSH host key prompt
  - [ ] Verify write('yes\n') is called
  - [ ] Verify write() is called exactly once
- [ ] Step 4: Verify auto-response
  - [ ] Assert write('yes\n') is called
  - [ ] Assert write() is called exactly once
  - [ ] Assert response is correct

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Auto-response is sent
  - Acceptance: write('yes\n') is called when prompt is detected
  - Acceptance: Response is correct
- [ ] Requirement 2: Response is sent once
  - Acceptance: write() is called exactly once
  - Acceptance: No duplicate responses
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Prompt appears multiple times (verify only one response)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining auto-response behavior

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify auto-response works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 10: CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-10.4.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-10.4.1, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Auto-response should be sent exactly once
  - Response should be 'yes\n'
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-10.4.1

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-10.4.1
- Next: TASK-10.4.3
- Dependencies: TASK-10.4.1, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-10.4: CursorCLI - SSH Host Key Prompt (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Auto-response is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want SSH prompts auto-responded so connections work automatically
- As a **system**, I want auto-response so SSH connections don't hang

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies write('yes\n') is called once when prompt detected
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-9.3.1: Test CursorExecutionService.execute() builds correct cursor-cli command

**Section**: 9. Execution Orchestration
**Subsection**: 9.3.1
**Task ID**: TASK-9.3.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-9.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorExecutionService.execute()` builds the correct cursor-cli command with all required parameters. This ensures command construction works correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (execute method, command construction), `src/cursor-cli.ts` (command format)

## Current State

- CursorExecutionService.execute() exists
- Command construction exists
- `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for command construction may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies command construction.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorExecutionService.execute() implementation
- [ ] Review CursorCLI command format
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` and `createMockCursorCLI()` helpers

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'execute() builds correct cursor-cli command'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for CursorExecutionService execution flow tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `CommandParserService` if needed
- [ ] Step 3: Test execute() command construction
  - [ ] Call `execute()` with test request
  - [ ] Verify CursorCLI.executeCommand() was called
  - [ ] Verify command includes correct parameters (prompt, repository, etc.)
  - [ ] Verify command format matches expected structure
- [ ] Step 4: Verify command structure
  - [ ] Assert command includes all required parameters
  - [ ] Assert command format is correct

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Command is built correctly
  - Acceptance: CursorCLI.executeCommand() is called with correct command
  - Acceptance: Command includes all required parameters
- [ ] Requirement 2: Command format is correct
  - Acceptance: Command matches expected format
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Command with optional parameters (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining command construction

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify command construction works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 9: Execution Orchestration
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-9.2.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-9.2.3, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Command should include all necessary parameters
  - Command format should match CursorCLI expectations
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-9.2.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-9.2.3
- Next: TASK-9.3.2
- Dependencies: TASK-9.2.3, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Command construction is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want correct command construction so cursor-cli receives proper commands
- As a **system**, I want proper commands so execution works correctly

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies command is built correctly
- Test passes
- All tests pass

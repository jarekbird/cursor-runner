# TASK-3.1.1: Test GET /health returns 200 with expected response

**Section**: 3. HTTP Server - Health & Diagnostics
**Subsection**: 3.1.1
**Task ID**: TASK-3.1.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-3.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `GET /health` returns 200 status code with the expected response body `{ status: 'ok', service: 'cursor-runner' }`. This ensures the basic health check endpoint works correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (health endpoint)

## Current State

- Health endpoint exists in server
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- `supertest` is available for HTTP testing
- Test for health endpoint may not exist yet

**Important**: This is the first HTTP endpoint test and establishes the pattern for endpoint testing.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review health endpoint implementation in `src/server.ts`
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Review `supertest` usage patterns
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper from Phase 1.1

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'GET /health returns 200 with expected response'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for health endpoint tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test server
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper to create server instance
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test health endpoint
  - [ ] Make GET request to `/health`
  - [ ] Verify response status is 200
  - [ ] Verify response body matches `{ status: 'ok', service: 'cursor-runner' }`
- [ ] Step 4: Verify response structure
  - [ ] Use `assertSuccessResponse()` helper from Phase 1.1
  - [ ] Verify response is valid JSON
  - [ ] Verify all expected fields are present

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Response status is 200
  - Acceptance: HTTP status code is 200
  - Acceptance: No errors are thrown
- [ ] Requirement 2: Response body is correct
  - Acceptance: Response contains `status: 'ok'`
  - Acceptance: Response contains `service: 'cursor-runner'`
  - Acceptance: Response matches expected structure exactly
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Server is properly cleaned up

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Server not started
  - Verify appropriate error (if applicable)
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: Invalid request method
  - Verify 405 Method Not Allowed (if applicable)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration` (or appropriate script)
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining what is being tested
- [ ] Document expected response format

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify response matches expected contract
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 3: HTTP Server - Health & Diagnostics
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after Phase 1 and Phase 2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-1.1.4 (createMockServer helper), TASK-1.1.6 (assertSuccessResponse helper)
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Use test helpers from Phase 1.1
  - Follow existing test patterns in server.test.ts
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after Phase 1.1

- Previous: TASK-2.6.4
- Next: TASK-3.1.2
- Dependencies: TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Response status and body are verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want a health check endpoint so I can verify the server is running
- As a **monitoring system**, I want a health endpoint so I can check service status

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies GET /health returns 200
- Test verifies response body matches expected format
- Test passes
- All tests pass

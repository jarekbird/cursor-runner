# TASK-5.5.5: Test POST /api/:conversationId/message triggers background iterate() with queueType='api'

**Section**: 5. HTTP Server - Conversation API
**Subsection**: 5.5.5
**Task ID**: TASK-5.5.5
**Parent Task**: TASK-5.5

## Description

Write a test to verify that `POST /api/:conversationId/message` triggers background `cursorExecution.iterate()` with `queueType='api'` after returning the immediate response. This ensures background processing happens with the correct queue type.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /api/:conversationId/message endpoint, background processing)

## Current State

- POST /api/:conversationId/message endpoint exists
- Background processing exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for background iterate() with queueType may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies background processing with correct queue type.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /api/:conversationId/message endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review how background processing is implemented
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'POST /api/:conversationId/message triggers background iterate() with queueType=api'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other /api/:conversationId/message tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `conversationService.getConversationById()` to return test conversation
  - [ ] Mock `cursorExecution.iterate()` to track when it's called and with what parameters
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test message endpoint
  - [ ] Make POST request to `/api/test-conversation-id/message` with body: `{ message: 'test message' }`
  - [ ] Verify immediate 200 response
  - [ ] Wait for background processing
  - [ ] Verify iterate() was called
  - [ ] Verify iterate() was called with queueType: 'api'
- [ ] Step 4: Verify background processing
  - [ ] Assert iterate() is called after response is sent
  - [ ] Assert iterate() receives queueType: 'api'
  - [ ] Assert iterate() receives correct conversation ID and message

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Background processing happens
  - Acceptance: iterate() is called after response is sent
  - Acceptance: iterate() is called with correct parameters
- [ ] Requirement 2: Queue type is correct
  - Acceptance: iterate() is called with queueType: 'api'
  - Acceptance: Queue type is hardcoded to 'api' for API endpoint
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: No hanging promises or timers

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: iterate() throws
  - Verify error is handled in background (may be separate test)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify background processing works
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining background processing
- [ ] Document queueType='api' requirement

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify background processing works correctly
- [ ] Verify queueType is correct
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 5: HTTP Server - Conversation API
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-5.5.4
- **Dependencies**: TASK-5.5.4, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Background processing should happen after response
  - Queue type should be 'api' for API endpoint
  - Need to wait appropriately in test to verify processing
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-5.5.4

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-5.5.4
- Next: TASK-6.1.1
- Dependencies: TASK-5.5.4, TASK-1.1.4
- Related:
  - TASK-5.5: POST /api/:conversationId/message (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Background processing is verified
4. Queue type is verified
5. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
6. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
7. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want background processing so long-running iterations don't block requests
- As a **system**, I want correct queue type so API requests are routed to the right queue

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies iterate() is called in background
- Test verifies queueType='api' is used
- Test passes
- All tests pass

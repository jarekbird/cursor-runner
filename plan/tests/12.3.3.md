# TASK-12.3.3: Test MigrationRunner.runMigrations() applies all migrations once

**Section**: 12. Persistence & Migrations
**Subsection**: 12.3.3
**Task ID**: TASK-12.3.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-12.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `MigrationRunner.runMigrations()` applies all migrations exactly once. This ensures migrations are executed correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/migrations/` (runMigrations method)

## Current State

- MigrationRunner.runMigrations() exists
- Migration execution exists
- `tests/migrations.test.ts` exists
- Test for migration execution may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies migration execution.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review MigrationRunner.runMigrations() implementation
- [ ] Review existing migrations
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/migrations.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createTempSqliteDb()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'runMigrations() applies all migrations once'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other migration tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test database
  - [ ] Use `createTempSqliteDb()` helper in `beforeAll`
  - [ ] Ensure schema_migrations table exists
- [ ] Step 3: Test migration execution
  - [ ] Call `runMigrations()`
  - [ ] Verify all migrations are applied
  - [ ] Verify each migration is recorded in schema_migrations table
  - [ ] Verify database schema matches expected state
- [ ] Step 4: Verify migration execution
  - [ ] Assert all migrations are applied
  - [ ] Assert migrations are recorded
  - [ ] Assert schema is correct

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: All migrations are applied
  - Acceptance: All migrations in migrations directory are executed
- [ ] Requirement 2: Migrations are recorded
  - Acceptance: Each migration is recorded in schema_migrations table
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/migrations.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining migration execution

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify migration execution works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 12: Persistence & Migrations
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-12.3.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-12.3.2, TASK-1.1.2, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - All migrations should be applied
  - Migrations should be recorded
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-12.3.2

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-12.3.2
- Next: TASK-12.3.4
- Dependencies: TASK-12.3.2, TASK-1.1.2, TASK-1.1.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/migrations.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Migration execution is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want migrations applied so database schema is up to date
- As a **system**, I want migration execution so I can evolve the schema

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies all migrations are applied once
- Test passes
- All tests pass

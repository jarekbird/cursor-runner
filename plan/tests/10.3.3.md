# TASK-10.3.3: Test CursorCLI logs reflect PTY vs spawn usage

**Section**: 10. CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
**Subsection**: 10.3.3
**Task ID**: TASK-10.3.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-10.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorCLI.executeCommand()` logs whether PTY or spawn is used. This ensures visibility into which execution method is used.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-cli.ts` (executeCommand method, logging)

## Current State

- CursorCLI.executeCommand() exists
- Logging exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts` exists
- Test for PTY/spawn logging may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies logging of execution method.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorCLI.executeCommand() implementation
- [ ] Review logging implementation
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'logs reflect PTY vs spawn usage'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other PTY tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper
  - [ ] Set up logger spy to capture log messages
  - [ ] Test case 1: Mock PTY available and used
  - [ ] Test case 2: Mock PTY unavailable, spawn used
- [ ] Step 3: Test logging
  - [ ] Test case 1: Call `executeCommand()` with PTY available
  - [ ] Verify log indicates PTY is used
  - [ ] Test case 2: Call `executeCommand()` with PTY unavailable
  - [ ] Verify log indicates spawn is used
- [ ] Step 4: Verify logging
  - [ ] Assert log messages indicate execution method
  - [ ] Assert log messages are clear

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Logging is accurate
  - Acceptance: Log indicates PTY when PTY is used
  - Acceptance: Log indicates spawn when spawn is used
- [ ] Requirement 2: Log messages are clear
  - Acceptance: Log messages are informative
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: PTY fallback (verify log indicates fallback)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining logging

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify logging works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 10: CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-10.3.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-10.3.2, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Logging provides visibility into execution method
  - Logs should be clear and informative
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-10.3.2

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-10.3.2
- Next: TASK-10.4.1
- Dependencies: TASK-10.3.2, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-10.3: CursorCLI - PTY vs Spawn (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Logging is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want execution method logged so I can debug execution issues
- As an **operator**, I want visibility into execution method so I can monitor system behavior

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies logs reflect PTY vs spawn usage
- Test passes
- All tests pass

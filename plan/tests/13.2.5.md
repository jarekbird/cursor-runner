# TASK-13.2.5: Test CursorRunner.validateGmailConfig() logs appropriately for all combinations

**Section**: 13. System Settings, Gmail MCP, Feature Flags
**Subsection**: 13.2.5
**Task ID**: TASK-13.2.5
**Parent Task**: TASK-13.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorRunner.validateGmailConfig()` logs appropriately for all combinations of `ENABLE_GMAIL_MCP` and required environment variables. This ensures logging is comprehensive and helpful.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/index.ts` (CursorRunner.validateGmailConfig method, logging)

## Current State

- CursorRunner.validateGmailConfig() exists
- Logging logic exists
- `tests/system-settings-gmail-validation.test.ts` exists
- Test for logging combinations may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies comprehensive logging.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorRunner.validateGmailConfig() implementation
- [ ] Review logging logic for different combinations
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/system-settings-gmail-validation.test.ts`
- [ ] Use test environment setup and logger mocking

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'CursorRunner.validateGmailConfig() logs appropriately for all combinations'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other Gmail MCP tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test environment
  - [ ] Use `beforeEach` to save original env vars
  - [ ] Set up logger spy to capture log messages
  - [ ] Use `afterEach` to restore original env vars
- [ ] Step 3: Test validateGmailConfig() logging for combinations
  - [ ] Test case 1: ENABLE_GMAIL_MCP=true, all vars present - verify success log
  - [ ] Test case 2: ENABLE_GMAIL_MCP=true, vars missing - verify warning log
  - [ ] Test case 3: ENABLE_GMAIL_MCP=false, vars present - verify info log (if applicable)
  - [ ] Test case 4: ENABLE_GMAIL_MCP=false, vars missing - verify info log (if applicable)
- [ ] Step 4: Verify logging
  - [ ] Assert appropriate log level is used
  - [ ] Assert log messages are clear and helpful

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Logging is appropriate
  - Acceptance: Correct log level for each combination
  - Acceptance: Log messages are clear
- [ ] Requirement 2: All combinations are covered
  - Acceptance: All combinations have appropriate logs
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Invalid ENABLE_GMAIL_MCP value (verify logging)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/system-settings-gmail-validation.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining logging behavior

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify logging works correctly for all combinations
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 13: System Settings, Gmail MCP, Feature Flags
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-13.2.4
- **Dependencies**: TASK-13.2.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Logging should be helpful for debugging
  - All combinations should be covered
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-13.2.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/system-settings-gmail-validation.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Logging is verified for all combinations
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want appropriate logging so I can debug configuration issues
- As a **system**, I want comprehensive logging so configuration state is clear

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies logging for all combinations
- Test passes
- All tests pass

### Step 10.5: CursorCLI - Output Size Limits
**Objective**: Test output size protection.

This task has been broken down into granular subtasks:

1. [TASK-10.5.1](./10.5.1.md): Test command is killed when output exceeds CURSOR_CLI_MAX_OUTPUT_SIZE
2. [TASK-10.5.2](./10.5.2.md): Test descriptive error is thrown with size limit information

**Note**: Complete all subtasks in order (10.5.1 → 10.5.2). Each subtask is independently completable with its own Definition of Done.

**Original Tasks**:
1. Extend `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`:
   - Add test: Command is killed when output exceeds `CURSOR_CLI_MAX_OUTPUT_SIZE`
   - Add test: Descriptive error is thrown with size limit information
   - Mock `spawn` to simulate large output

**Tests**:
- Verify size limit enforcement
- Verify error messages

**Verification**:
- Tests pass
- Size limits are enforced

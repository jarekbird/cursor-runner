# TASK-13.1.4: Test closeDatabase() closes without throwing

**Section**: 13. System Settings, Gmail MCP, Feature Flags
**Subsection**: 13.1.4
**Task ID**: TASK-13.1.4
**Parent Task**: TASK-13.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `closeDatabase()` closes the database connection without throwing exceptions. This ensures cleanup works correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/system-settings.ts` (closeDatabase method)

## Current State

- SystemSettings.closeDatabase() exists
- Database cleanup exists
- `tests/system-settings.test.ts` exists
- Test for closeDatabase may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies database cleanup.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review SystemSettings.closeDatabase() implementation
- [ ] Review database cleanup logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/system-settings.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createTempSqliteDb()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'closeDatabase() closes without throwing'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other system settings tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test database
  - [ ] Use `createTempSqliteDb()` helper
  - [ ] Initialize SystemSettings with test database
- [ ] Step 3: Test closeDatabase()
  - [ ] Call `closeDatabase()`
  - [ ] Verify no exception is thrown
  - [ ] Verify database connection is closed
- [ ] Step 4: Verify cleanup
  - [ ] Assert no exception is thrown
  - [ ] Assert database is closed

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: No exception is thrown
  - Acceptance: closeDatabase() completes without throwing
  - Acceptance: Cleanup is graceful
- [ ] Requirement 2: Database is closed
  - Acceptance: Database connection is closed
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: closeDatabase() called multiple times (verify idempotency)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/system-settings.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining cleanup behavior

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify cleanup works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 13: System Settings, Gmail MCP, Feature Flags
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-13.1.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-13.1.3, TASK-1.1.2
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Cleanup should be graceful
  - Should be idempotent
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-13.1.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-13.1.3
- Next: TASK-13.2.1
- Dependencies: TASK-13.1.3, TASK-1.1.2

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/system-settings.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Cleanup is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want graceful cleanup so resources are freed
- As a **system**, I want cleanup so no resource leaks occur

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies closeDatabase() doesn't throw
- Test passes
- All tests pass

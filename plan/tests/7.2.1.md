# TASK-7.2.1: Test GET /api/tasks returns all tasks when no filter

**Section**: 7. HTTP Server - Tasks API
**Subsection**: 7.2.1
**Task ID**: TASK-7.2.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-7.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `GET /api/tasks` returns all tasks when no status filter is provided. This ensures the listing endpoint works correctly without filters.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (GET /api/tasks endpoint), `src/task-service.ts` (listTasks method)

## Current State

- GET /api/tasks endpoint exists
- TaskService.listTasks() exists
- `tests/tasks-api.test.ts` exists (from TASK-7.1.1)
- Test for unfiltered listing may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies basic listing functionality.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review GET /api/tasks endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review TaskService.listTasks() method
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/tasks-api.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'GET /api/tasks returns all tasks when no filter'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for /api/tasks endpoint tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test data
  - [ ] Use `beforeEach` to create test tasks with different statuses
  - [ ] Create tasks with status 0 (ready) and status 1 (complete)
  - [ ] Use helper to reset DB state if needed
- [ ] Step 3: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 4: Test endpoint without filter
  - [ ] Make GET request to `/api/tasks` (no query parameters)
  - [ ] Verify response status is 200
  - [ ] Verify response body contains all tasks
  - [ ] Verify all created tasks are returned
- [ ] Step 5: Verify response structure
  - [ ] Use `assertSuccessResponse()` helper
  - [ ] Verify tasks array structure
  - [ ] Verify each task includes `status_label` field

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: All tasks are returned
  - Acceptance: Response contains all tasks from database
  - Acceptance: No filtering is applied
- [ ] Requirement 2: Response includes status_label
  - Acceptance: Each task has `status_label` field
  - Acceptance: `status_label` is correct for each status
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: DB state is reset between tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: No tasks in database (empty array)
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: Many tasks (verify all are returned)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/tasks-api.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining unfiltered listing
- [ ] Document expected response structure

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify all tasks are returned
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 7: HTTP Server - Tasks API
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-7.1.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-7.1.1, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Use real SQLite DB (not mocked) for integration tests
  - Test data should be created in beforeEach
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-7.1.1

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-7.1.1
- Next: TASK-7.2.2
- Dependencies: TASK-7.1.1, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6

  - TASK-7.2: GET /api/tasks (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/tasks-api.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Unfiltered listing is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want to list all tasks so I can see all available tasks
- As a **client**, I want unfiltered listing so I can get all tasks

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies all tasks are returned when no filter
- Test verifies response includes status_label
- Test passes
- All tests pass

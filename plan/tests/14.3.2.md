# TASK-14.3.2: Test TerminalService has no hanging timers or child processes

**Section**: 14. Filesystem & Workspace Services
**Subsection**: 14.3.2
**Task ID**: TASK-14.3.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-14.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `TerminalService` doesn't leave hanging timers or child processes after operations complete. This ensures no resource leaks from timers or processes.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/terminal-service.ts` (timer and process cleanup)

## Current State

- TerminalService exists
- Timer and process cleanup exists
- `tests/terminal-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for hanging resources may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies no resource leaks.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review TerminalService implementation
- [ ] Review timer and process management
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/terminal-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use child process and timer mocking

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'No hanging timers or child processes'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other TerminalService tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Mock timers (setTimeout, setInterval)
  - [ ] Mock child processes
  - [ ] Track timer and process creation
- [ ] Step 3: Test for hanging resources
  - [ ] Create TerminalService instance and start operation
  - [ ] Complete operation
  - [ ] Verify all timers are cleared
  - [ ] Verify all child processes are terminated
  - [ ] Wait briefly and verify no timers fire
- [ ] Step 4: Verify no hanging resources
  - [ ] Assert all timers are cleared
  - [ ] Assert all processes are terminated
  - [ ] Assert no resources remain active

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Timers are cleared
  - Acceptance: All timers are cleared on completion
  - Acceptance: No timers fire after completion
- [ ] Requirement 2: Processes are terminated
  - Acceptance: All child processes are terminated
  - Acceptance: No processes remain running
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Operation timeout (verify cleanup still occurs)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/terminal-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining resource management

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify no hanging resources
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 14: Filesystem & Workspace Services
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-14.3.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-14.3.1
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Hanging resources cause memory leaks
  - Should verify both timers and processes
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-14.3.1

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/terminal-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. No hanging resources verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want no hanging resources so the system doesn't leak memory
- As a **system**, I want proper cleanup so resources are managed correctly

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies no hanging timers or processes
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-9.1.1: Test CursorExecutionService.execute() returns error when TARGET_APP_PATH is missing and no repository provided

**Section**: 9. Execution Orchestration
**Subsection**: 9.1.1
**Task ID**: TASK-9.1.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-9.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorExecutionService.execute()` returns an error when `TARGET_APP_PATH` environment variable is missing and no repository is provided in the request. This ensures proper validation for repository path resolution.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (execute method, repository validation)

## Current State

- CursorExecutionService.execute() exists
- Repository validation exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts` exists (or needs to be created)
- Test for TARGET_APP_PATH validation may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies repository path validation.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorExecutionService.execute() implementation
- [ ] Review repository validation logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'execute() returns error when TARGET_APP_PATH is missing and no repository provided'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for CursorExecutionService repository validation tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test environment
  - [ ] Use `beforeEach` to save original TARGET_APP_PATH value
  - [ ] Delete `TARGET_APP_PATH` from `process.env`
  - [ ] Use `afterEach` to restore original env var
- [ ] Step 3: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `GitService`, `FilesystemService`, `WorkspaceTrustService` if needed
- [ ] Step 4: Test execute() without repository
  - [ ] Call `execute()` with request that has no repository field
  - [ ] Verify error is returned
  - [ ] Verify error message indicates TARGET_APP_PATH is missing or repository is required
- [ ] Step 5: Verify error response
  - [ ] Assert error response structure is correct
  - [ ] Assert error message is clear

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Error is returned
  - Acceptance: execute() returns error response
  - Acceptance: Error indicates missing TARGET_APP_PATH or repository
- [ ] Requirement 2: Error message is clear
  - Acceptance: Error message is actionable
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Env var is restored after test

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: TARGET_APP_PATH is empty string (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining validation

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify validation is correct
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 9: Execution Orchestration
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-8.2.5
- **Dependencies**: TASK-8.2.5, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - TARGET_APP_PATH or repository must be provided
  - Must properly clean up env vars
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-8.2.5

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-8.2.5
- Next: TASK-9.1.2
- Dependencies: TASK-8.2.5, TASK-1.1.4
- Related:
  - TASK-9.1: CursorExecutionService - Repository Validation (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Validation is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want validation errors so I know when repository path is missing
- As a **system**, I want validation so I don't execute commands in invalid locations

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies error when TARGET_APP_PATH is missing and no repository provided
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-11.1.3: Test ConversationService.getConversationId() creates new conversation when last-conversation key missing

**Section**: 11. Redis-based Conversation Services
**Subsection**: 11.1.3
**Task ID**: TASK-11.1.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-11.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `ConversationService.getConversationId()` creates a new conversation when the last-conversation key is missing. This ensures new conversations are created when needed.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/conversation-service.ts` (getConversationId method, new conversation creation)

## Current State

- ConversationService.getConversationId() exists
- New conversation creation exists
- `tests/conversation-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for new conversation creation may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies new conversation creation.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review ConversationService.getConversationId() implementation
- [ ] Review new conversation creation logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'getConversationId() creates new conversation when last-conversation key missing'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other getConversationId tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper
  - [ ] Mock Redis to return null for last-conversation key (key doesn't exist)
  - [ ] Track conversation creation operations
- [ ] Step 3: Test new conversation creation
  - [ ] Call `getConversationId()` with no explicit ID, queueType: 'api'
  - [ ] Verify new conversation is created
  - [ ] Verify new conversation ID is returned
  - [ ] Verify last-conversation key is set to new conversation ID
- [ ] Step 4: Verify new conversation creation
  - [ ] Assert new conversation ID is generated
  - [ ] Assert conversation is created in Redis
  - [ ] Assert last-conversation key is updated

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: New conversation is created
  - Acceptance: New conversation ID is generated
  - Acceptance: Conversation is created in Redis
- [ ] Requirement 2: Last-conversation key is updated
  - Acceptance: Last-conversation key is set to new conversation ID
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Redis error during creation (verify error handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining new conversation creation

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify new conversation creation works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 11: Redis-based Conversation Services
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-11.1.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-11.1.2, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - New conversations should be created when last-conversation key is missing
  - Last-conversation key should be updated with new ID
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-11.1.2

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-11.1.2
- Next: TASK-11.1.4
- Dependencies: TASK-11.1.2, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. New conversation creation is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want new conversations created so I can start fresh conversations
- As a **system**, I want automatic conversation creation so I don't fail when key is missing

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies new conversation is created when last-conversation key missing
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-12.1.1: Test TaskService.listTasks() returns all tasks ordered by order then id

**Section**: 12. Persistence & Migrations
**Subsection**: 12.1.1
**Task ID**: TASK-12.1.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-12.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `TaskService.listTasks()` returns all tasks ordered by `order` then `id`. This ensures task ordering works correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/task-service.ts` (listTasks method)

## Current State

- TaskService.listTasks() exists
- Ordering exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/task-service.test.ts` exists (or needs to be created)
- Test for task ordering may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies task ordering.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review TaskService.listTasks() implementation
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/task-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createTempSqliteDb()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'listTasks() returns all tasks ordered by order then id'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for TaskService basic operations tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test database
  - [ ] Use `createTempSqliteDb()` helper in `beforeAll`
  - [ ] Run migrations to set up schema
- [ ] Step 3: Set up test data
  - [ ] Create multiple test tasks with different order values
  - [ ] Create tasks with same order but different ids
- [ ] Step 4: Test ordering
  - [ ] Call `listTasks()` with no filter
  - [ ] Verify all tasks are returned
  - [ ] Verify tasks are ordered by order (ascending) then id (ascending)
- [ ] Step 5: Verify ordering
  - [ ] Assert tasks are sorted by order first
  - [ ] Assert tasks with same order are sorted by id

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: All tasks are returned
  - Acceptance: All tasks in database are returned
- [ ] Requirement 2: Ordering is correct
  - Acceptance: Tasks are ordered by order then id
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/task-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining ordering

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify ordering works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 12: Persistence & Migrations
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-11.5.5
- **Dependencies**: TASK-11.5.5, TASK-1.1.2, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Ordering should be by order then id
  - Use real SQLite database for integration test
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-11.5.5

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-11.5.5
- Next: TASK-12.1.2
- Dependencies: TASK-11.5.5, TASK-1.1.2, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-12.1: TaskService - Basic Operations (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/task-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Task ordering is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want tasks ordered so I can display them in correct order
- As a **client**, I want ordered tasks so I can process them in priority order

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies tasks are ordered by order then id
- Test passes
- All tests pass

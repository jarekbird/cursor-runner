# TASK-13.3.4: Test shouldSendElevenLabsCallback() returns true for non-ElevenLabs URLs

**Section**: 13. System Settings, Gmail MCP, Feature Flags
**Subsection**: 13.3.4
**Task ID**: TASK-13.3.4
**Parent Task**: TASK-13.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `shouldSendElevenLabsCallback()` returns true for non-ElevenLabs URLs. This ensures callbacks are sent for regular URLs.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/feature-flags.ts` (shouldSendElevenLabsCallback method)

## Current State

- shouldSendElevenLabsCallback() exists
- Callback decision logic exists
- `tests/feature-flags.test.ts` exists
- Test for non-ElevenLabs URLs may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies callback sending for regular URLs.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review shouldSendElevenLabsCallback() implementation
- [ ] Review callback decision logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/feature-flags.test.ts`

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'shouldSendElevenLabsCallback() returns true for non-ElevenLabs URLs'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other ElevenLabs tests
- [ ] Step 2: Test callback decision for non-ElevenLabs URLs
  - [ ] Call `shouldSendElevenLabsCallback()` with non-ElevenLabs URL
  - [ ] Verify true is returned
  - [ ] Verify callback should be sent
- [ ] Step 3: Verify callback decision
  - [ ] Assert true is returned for non-ElevenLabs URLs
  - [ ] Assert callback sending is allowed

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: True is returned
  - Acceptance: Returns true for non-ElevenLabs URLs
  - Acceptance: Callback sending is allowed
- [ ] Requirement 2: Decision is correct
  - Acceptance: Non-ElevenLabs URLs trigger callback
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/feature-flags.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining callback decision

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify callback decision works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 13: System Settings, Gmail MCP, Feature Flags
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-13.3.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-13.3.3
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Regular URLs should trigger callbacks
  - Only ElevenLabs URLs should be suppressed
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-13.3.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-13.3.3

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/feature-flags.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Callback decision is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want callbacks sent for regular URLs so normal flow works
- As a **system**, I want proper callback decisions so callbacks are sent appropriately

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies true is returned for non-ElevenLabs URLs
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-11.5.4: Test AgentConversationService.listConversations() applies pagination with limit and offset

**Section**: 11. Redis-based Conversation Services
**Subsection**: 11.5.4
**Task ID**: TASK-11.5.4
**Parent Task**: TASK-11.5

## Description

Write a test to verify that `AgentConversationService.listConversations()` applies pagination with `limit` and `offset` parameters. This ensures pagination works correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/agent-conversation-service.ts` (listConversations method, pagination)

## Current State

- AgentConversationService.listConversations() exists
- Pagination exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/agent-conversation-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for pagination may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies pagination functionality.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review AgentConversationService.listConversations() implementation
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/agent-conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'listConversations() applies pagination with limit and offset'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other list tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test data
  - [ ] Create multiple test conversations (more than limit)
- [ ] Step 3: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper
  - [ ] Mock Redis to return test conversations
- [ ] Step 4: Test pagination
  - [ ] Test case 1: Call `listConversations()` with limit: 5, offset: 0
  - [ ] Verify 5 conversations are returned
  - [ ] Test case 2: Call `listConversations()` with limit: 5, offset: 5
  - [ ] Verify next 5 conversations are returned
  - [ ] Verify pagination metadata is included
- [ ] Step 5: Verify pagination
  - [ ] Assert limit is respected
  - [ ] Assert offset works correctly
  - [ ] Assert pagination metadata is correct

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Pagination works
  - Acceptance: Limit is respected
  - Acceptance: Offset works correctly
- [ ] Requirement 2: Pagination metadata is included
  - Acceptance: Response includes pagination info (total, hasMore, etc.)
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Offset beyond available conversations (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/agent-conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining pagination

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify pagination works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 11: Redis-based Conversation Services
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-11.5.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-11.5.3, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Pagination should work correctly
  - Metadata should be included
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-11.5.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-11.5.3
- Next: TASK-11.5.5
- Dependencies: TASK-11.5.3, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-11.5: AgentConversationService - List with Sorting & Pagination (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/agent-conversation-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Pagination is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want pagination so I can handle large result sets
- As a **client**, I want pagination so I can load conversations incrementally

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies pagination with limit and offset
- Test passes
- All tests pass

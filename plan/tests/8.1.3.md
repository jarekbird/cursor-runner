# TASK-8.1.3: Test GET /repositories/api/:repository/files returns file tree when repository exists

**Section**: 8. HTTP Server - Repository & Telegram Routes
**Subsection**: 8.1.3
**Task ID**: TASK-8.1.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-8.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `GET /repositories/api/:repository/files` returns a file tree when the repository exists. This ensures the file tree endpoint works correctly for valid repositories.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (GET /repositories/api/:repository/files endpoint), `src/file-tree-service.ts` (buildFileTree method)

## Current State

- GET /repositories/api/:repository/files endpoint exists
- FileTreeService.buildFileTree() exists
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for file tree generation may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies file tree generation for repositories.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review GET /repositories/api/:repository/files endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review FileTreeService.buildFileTree() method
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'GET /repositories/api/:repository/files returns file tree when repository exists'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other /repositories/api/:repository/files tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `filesystem.exists()` to return true for existing repository
  - [ ] Mock `FileTreeService.buildFileTree()` to return test file tree structure
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test endpoint with existing repository
  - [ ] Make GET request to `/repositories/api/test-repo/files`
  - [ ] Verify response status is 200
  - [ ] Verify response body contains file tree
  - [ ] Verify file tree matches mocked return value
- [ ] Step 4: Verify file tree structure
  - [ ] Use `assertSuccessResponse()` helper
  - [ ] Verify file tree structure is correct
  - [ ] Verify tree includes expected fields

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: File tree is returned
  - Acceptance: Response contains file tree from buildFileTree()
  - Acceptance: File tree structure is correct
- [ ] Requirement 2: Response status is 200
  - Acceptance: HTTP status code is 200
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Empty repository (verify empty tree is returned)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify file tree is returned correctly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining file tree structure

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify file tree response is correct
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 8: HTTP Server - Repository & Telegram Routes
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-8.1.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-8.1.2, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - File tree should match FileTreeService output
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-8.1.2

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. File tree response is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want file tree listing so I can browse repository structure
- As a **client**, I want file tree so I can display repository contents

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies file tree is returned when repository exists
- Test passes
- All tests pass

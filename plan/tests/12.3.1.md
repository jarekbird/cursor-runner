# TASK-12.3.1: Test MigrationRunner.ensureSchemaMigrationsTable() creates table when missing

**Section**: 12. Persistence & Migrations
**Subsection**: 12.3.1
**Task ID**: TASK-12.3.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-12.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `MigrationRunner.ensureSchemaMigrationsTable()` creates the schema_migrations table when it is missing. This ensures migration tracking table is created.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/migrations/` (ensureSchemaMigrationsTable method)

## Current State

- MigrationRunner.ensureSchemaMigrationsTable() exists
- Table creation exists
- `tests/migrations.test.ts` exists (or needs to be created)
- Test for table creation may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies migration table creation.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review MigrationRunner.ensureSchemaMigrationsTable() implementation
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/migrations.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createTempSqliteDb()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'ensureSchemaMigrationsTable() creates table when missing'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for MigrationRunner tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test database
  - [ ] Use `createTempSqliteDb()` helper in `beforeAll`
  - [ ] Ensure schema_migrations table does not exist
- [ ] Step 3: Test table creation
  - [ ] Call `ensureSchemaMigrationsTable()`
  - [ ] Verify schema_migrations table is created
  - [ ] Verify table has correct structure
- [ ] Step 4: Verify table creation
  - [ ] Assert table exists
  - [ ] Assert table structure is correct

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Table is created
  - Acceptance: schema_migrations table is created when missing
- [ ] Requirement 2: Table structure is correct
  - Acceptance: Table has required columns
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/migrations.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining table creation

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify table creation works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 12: Persistence & Migrations
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-12.2.5
- **Dependencies**: TASK-12.2.5, TASK-1.1.2, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Table should be created when missing
  - Table structure should be correct
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-12.2.5

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/migrations.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Table creation is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want migration table created so migrations can be tracked
- As a **system**, I want migration tracking so I know which migrations ran

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies schema_migrations table is created when missing
- Test passes
- All tests pass

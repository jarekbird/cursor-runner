# TASK-7.4.6: Test POST /api/tasks returns 201 with created task including status_label

**Section**: 7. HTTP Server - Tasks API
**Subsection**: 7.4.6
**Task ID**: TASK-7.4.6
**Parent Task**: TASK-7.4

## Description

Write a test to verify that `POST /api/tasks` returns 201 status code with the created task including `status_label` field. This ensures the response includes all necessary fields.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /api/tasks endpoint)

## Current State

- POST /api/tasks endpoint exists
- status_label computation exists
- `tests/tasks-api.test.ts` exists
- Test for response with status_label may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies response structure and status_label inclusion.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /api/tasks endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review how status_label is computed
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/tasks-api.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'POST /api/tasks returns 201 with created task including status_label'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other /api/tasks POST tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test endpoint
  - [ ] Make POST request to `/api/tasks` with body: `{ prompt: 'test prompt' }`
  - [ ] Verify response status is 201
  - [ ] Verify response body contains created task
  - [ ] Verify task includes all expected fields
- [ ] Step 4: Verify response structure
  - [ ] Use `assertSuccessResponse()` helper
  - [ ] Verify task object has expected structure
  - [ ] Verify task includes `status_label` field
  - [ ] Verify `status_label` value is correct for task status
  - [ ] Verify task includes id, prompt, order, status, createdat, updatedat

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Response status is 201
  - Acceptance: HTTP status code is 201 (created)
  - Acceptance: Response indicates success
- [ ] Requirement 2: Response includes created task
  - Acceptance: Response body contains task object
  - Acceptance: Task data matches created task
- [ ] Requirement 3: status_label is included
  - Acceptance: Task includes `status_label` field
  - Acceptance: `status_label` value is correct
- [ ] Requirement 4: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Task with status 0 (verify status_label is 'ready')
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: Task with status 1 (verify status_label is 'complete')

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/tasks-api.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify response structure is correct
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining response structure
- [ ] Document expected response format

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify response structure is correct
- [ ] Verify status_label is included and correct
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 7: HTTP Server - Tasks API
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-7.4.5
- **Dependencies**: TASK-7.4.5, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Response should be 201 (not 200) for creation
  - status_label should be computed and included
  - Use real database for integration test
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-7.4.5

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-7.4.5
- Next: TASK-7.5.1
- Dependencies: TASK-7.4.5, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6

  - TASK-7.4: POST /api/tasks (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/tasks-api.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Response status is verified (201)
4. Response structure is verified
5. status_label is verified
6. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
7. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
8. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want 201 response so I know task was created
- As a **client**, I want created task with status_label so I can use it immediately

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies 201 status code
- Test verifies created task is returned
- Test verifies status_label is included
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-10.1.1: Test CursorCLI multiple concurrent executeCommand() calls respect CURSOR_CLI_MAX_CONCURRENT

**Section**: 10. CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
**Subsection**: 10.1.1
**Task ID**: TASK-10.1.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-10.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that multiple concurrent `CursorCLI.executeCommand()` calls respect the `CURSOR_CLI_MAX_CONCURRENT` limit. This ensures concurrency control works correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-cli.ts` (executeCommand method, semaphore implementation)

## Current State

- CursorCLI.executeCommand() exists
- Semaphore implementation exists
- `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts` exists (or needs to be created)
- Test for concurrency control may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies semaphore-based concurrency control.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorCLI.executeCommand() implementation
- [ ] Review semaphore implementation
- [ ] Review CURSOR_CLI_MAX_CONCURRENT configuration
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'multiple concurrent executeCommand() calls respect CURSOR_CLI_MAX_CONCURRENT'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for CursorCLI semaphore and queue status tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test environment
  - [ ] Set `CURSOR_CLI_MAX_CONCURRENT` to a test value (e.g., 2)
  - [ ] Use `beforeEach` to save original value
  - [ ] Use `afterEach` to restore original value
- [ ] Step 3: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `child_process.spawn` to simulate long-running commands
  - [ ] Track when commands start and complete
- [ ] Step 4: Test concurrent execution
  - [ ] Start multiple executeCommand() calls (more than MAX_CONCURRENT)
  - [ ] Verify only MAX_CONCURRENT commands run simultaneously
  - [ ] Verify other commands wait until slots are available
  - [ ] Verify all commands eventually complete
- [ ] Step 5: Verify concurrency control
  - [ ] Assert no more than MAX_CONCURRENT commands run at once
  - [ ] Assert waiting commands eventually execute

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Concurrency limit is enforced
  - Acceptance: No more than MAX_CONCURRENT commands run simultaneously
  - Acceptance: Additional commands wait
- [ ] Requirement 2: All commands complete
  - Acceptance: All commands eventually execute
  - Acceptance: No commands are lost
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Env var is restored after test

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: MAX_CONCURRENT is 1 (verify serial execution)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify concurrency control works correctly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining concurrency control

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify concurrency control works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 10: CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-9.5.4
- **Dependencies**: TASK-9.5.4, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Semaphore should enforce MAX_CONCURRENT limit
  - Commands should wait when limit is reached
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-9.5.4

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-9.5.4
- Next: TASK-10.1.2
- Dependencies: TASK-9.5.4, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-10.1: CursorCLI - Semaphore & Queue Status (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Concurrency control is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want concurrency control so commands don't overwhelm the system
- As a **system**, I want semaphore limits so I can manage resource usage

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies MAX_CONCURRENT limit is enforced
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-9.3.3: Test CursorExecutionService.execute() handles generic Error

**Section**: 9. Execution Orchestration
**Subsection**: 9.3.3
**Task ID**: TASK-9.3.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-9.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorExecutionService.execute()` handles generic `Error` exceptions (not just CommandError). This ensures all error types are properly handled.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (execute method, generic error handling)

## Current State

- CursorExecutionService.execute() exists
- Generic error handling exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for generic error handling may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies generic error handling.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorExecutionService.execute() implementation
- [ ] Review error handling logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` and `createMockCursorCLI()` helpers

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'execute() handles generic Error'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other execution flow tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `CursorCLI.executeCommand()` to throw generic Error
- [ ] Step 3: Test execute() with generic Error
  - [ ] Call `execute()` with test request
  - [ ] Verify error response is returned
  - [ ] Verify error response structure matches expected format
  - [ ] Verify error message is included
- [ ] Step 4: Verify error response
  - [ ] Assert error response structure is correct
  - [ ] Assert error message is included

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Generic Error is handled
  - Acceptance: Error response is returned when generic Error is thrown
  - Acceptance: Error is caught and handled
- [ ] Requirement 2: Error response structure is correct
  - Acceptance: Response structure matches expected format
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Error without message (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining generic error handling

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify generic error handling works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 9: Execution Orchestration
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-9.3.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-9.3.2, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Generic errors should be handled gracefully
  - Error response should be consistent
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-9.3.2

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-9.3.2
- Next: TASK-9.3.4
- Dependencies: TASK-9.3.2, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Generic error handling is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want generic error handling so all errors are caught
- As a **system**, I want error handling so execution doesn't crash

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies generic Error is handled
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-4.4.5: Test POST /cursor/iterate/async sends error callback with ErrorCallbackResponse structure

**Section**: 4. HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
**Subsection**: 4.4.5
**Task ID**: TASK-4.4.5
**Parent Task**: TASK-4.4

## Description

Write a test to verify that `POST /cursor/iterate/async` sends an error callback with the `ErrorCallbackResponse` structure (including `stdout`, `stderr`, `exitCode`, `iterations`, `maxIterations`) when iteration fails. This ensures error callbacks contain complete information.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /cursor/iterate/async endpoint, error callback), `src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (ErrorCallbackResponse structure)

## Current State

- POST /cursor/iterate/async endpoint exists
- Error callback handling exists (or needs to be implemented)
- ErrorCallbackResponse structure exists (or needs to be defined)
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for error callback structure may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies error callback payload structure.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /cursor/iterate/async endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review ErrorCallbackResponse structure definition
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
- [ ] Understand how to mock HTTP requests

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'POST /cursor/iterate/async sends error callback with ErrorCallbackResponse structure'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other cursor/iterate/async tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `cursorExecution.iterate()` to return error or throw
  - [ ] Mock HTTP client (fetch or axios) to capture callback requests
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test async iterate endpoint with error
  - [ ] Make POST request to `/cursor/iterate/async` with valid body
  - [ ] Wait for background processing to complete
  - [ ] Verify error callback webhook was sent
  - [ ] Verify callback payload matches ErrorCallbackResponse structure
- [ ] Step 4: Verify error callback payload structure
  - [ ] Assert callback payload includes `stdout` field
  - [ ] Assert callback payload includes `stderr` field
  - [ ] Assert callback payload includes `exitCode` field
  - [ ] Assert callback payload includes `iterations` field
  - [ ] Assert callback payload includes `maxIterations` field
  - [ ] Assert all fields have correct types

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Error callback is sent on failure
  - Acceptance: HTTP request is made to callbackUrl
  - Acceptance: Callback is sent after iteration fails
- [ ] Requirement 2: Error callback payload matches ErrorCallbackResponse structure
  - Acceptance: Payload includes all required fields: stdout, stderr, exitCode, iterations, maxIterations
  - Acceptance: Field types are correct
  - Acceptance: Payload structure matches expected format
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Mocks are properly cleaned up
  - Acceptance: No actual HTTP requests are made

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Partial iteration before error
  - Verify iterations count reflects completed iterations
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: No output before error
  - Verify stdout/stderr are empty strings or null

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify error callback payload structure is correct
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining ErrorCallbackResponse structure
- [ ] Document expected error callback payload format

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify error callback payload structure is correct
- [ ] Verify all required fields are present
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 4: HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-4.4.4
- **Dependencies**: TASK-4.4.4, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - ErrorCallbackResponse should include all relevant error information
  - Structure should be consistent and well-defined
  - Need to mock HTTP client to avoid real network requests
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-4.4.4

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-4.4.4
- Next: TASK-4.5.1
- Dependencies: TASK-4.4.4, TASK-1.1.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Error callback payload structure is verified
4. All required fields are verified
5. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
6. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
7. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want complete error information in callbacks so I can debug failures
- As a **client**, I want structured error callbacks so I can process failures programmatically

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies error callback includes all ErrorCallbackResponse fields
- Test verifies field types are correct
- Test passes
- All tests pass

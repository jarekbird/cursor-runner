# TASK-10.4.3: Test CursorCLI multiple SSH prompts don't cause multiple responses

**Section**: 10. CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
**Subsection**: 10.4.3
**Task ID**: TASK-10.4.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-10.4

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorCLI.executeCommand()` doesn't send multiple responses when multiple SSH host key prompts appear. This ensures no duplicate auto-responses.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-cli.ts` (executeCommand method, SSH prompt deduplication)

## Current State

- CursorCLI.executeCommand() exists
- SSH prompt deduplication exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts` exists
- Test for prompt deduplication may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies no duplicate responses.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorCLI.executeCommand() implementation
- [ ] Review SSH prompt deduplication logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'multiple SSH prompts don't cause multiple responses'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other SSH prompt tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper
  - [ ] Mock PTY to emit output containing multiple SSH prompts
  - [ ] Track write() calls on PTY
- [ ] Step 3: Test deduplication
  - [ ] Call `executeCommand()` with SSH command
  - [ ] Simulate PTY output containing multiple SSH host key prompts
  - [ ] Verify write('yes\n') is called only once
  - [ ] Verify no duplicate responses are sent
- [ ] Step 4: Verify deduplication
  - [ ] Assert write() is called only once
  - [ ] Assert no duplicate responses

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: No duplicate responses
  - Acceptance: write('yes\n') is called only once even with multiple prompts
  - Acceptance: Deduplication works correctly
- [ ] Requirement 2: Response is still sent
  - Acceptance: At least one response is sent
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Prompts appear at different times (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining deduplication behavior

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify deduplication works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 10: CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-10.4.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-10.4.2, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Multiple prompts should not cause multiple responses
  - Deduplication prevents duplicate responses
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-10.4.2

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-10.4.2
- Next: TASK-10.5.1
- Dependencies: TASK-10.4.2, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4
- Related:
  - TASK-10.4: CursorCLI - SSH Host Key Prompt (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Deduplication is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want no duplicate responses so SSH connections work correctly
- As a **system**, I want deduplication so I don't send unnecessary responses

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies multiple prompts don't cause multiple responses
- Test passes
- All tests pass

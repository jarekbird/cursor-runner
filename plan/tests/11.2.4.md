# TASK-11.2.4: Test ConversationService.getConversationContext() prefers summarized messages when available

**Section**: 11. Redis-based Conversation Services
**Subsection**: 11.2.4
**Task ID**: TASK-11.2.4
**Parent Task**: TASK-11.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `ConversationService.getConversationContext()` prefers summarized messages when available over individual messages. This ensures conversation summarization is used when present.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/conversation-service.ts` (getConversationContext method, summarized message preference)

## Current State

- ConversationService.getConversationContext() exists
- Summarized message preference exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/conversation-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for summarized message preference may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies summarization preference.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review ConversationService.getConversationContext() implementation
- [ ] Review how summarized messages are stored
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'getConversationContext() prefers summarized messages when available'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other conversation management tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test data
  - [ ] Create test conversation with both individual messages and summarized messages
  - [ ] Set up summarized message in Redis mock
- [ ] Step 3: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper
  - [ ] Mock Redis to return conversation with both individual and summarized messages
- [ ] Step 4: Test summarized message preference
  - [ ] Call `getConversationContext()` with test conversation ID
  - [ ] Verify summarized messages are returned (not individual messages)
  - [ ] Verify individual messages are not included when summary exists
- [ ] Step 5: Verify summarization preference
  - [ ] Assert summarized messages are preferred
  - [ ] Assert individual messages are excluded when summary exists

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Summarized messages are preferred
  - Acceptance: getConversationContext() returns summarized messages when available
  - Acceptance: Individual messages are not returned when summary exists
- [ ] Requirement 2: Preference is correct
  - Acceptance: Summary is used instead of individual messages
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Only individual messages (no summary) (verify individual messages are returned)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining summarization preference

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify summarization preference works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 11: Redis-based Conversation Services
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-11.2.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-11.2.3, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Summarized messages should be preferred for efficiency
  - Individual messages should be excluded when summary exists
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-11.2.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-11.2.3
- Next: TASK-11.3.1
- Dependencies: TASK-11.2.3, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-11.2: ConversationService - Conversation Management (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Summarization preference is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want summarized messages preferred so context is more efficient
- As a **system**, I want summarization so I can reduce context size

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies summarized messages are preferred when available
- Test passes
- All tests pass

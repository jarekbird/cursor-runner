# TASK-12.2.4: Test TaskService.deleteTask() returns true only when row deleted

**Section**: 12. Persistence & Migrations
**Subsection**: 12.2.4
**Task ID**: TASK-12.2.4
**Parent Task**: TASK-12.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `TaskService.deleteTask()` returns true only when a row is actually deleted, and false when no row is deleted. This ensures deletion behavior is correct.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/task-service.ts` (deleteTask method)

## Current State

- TaskService.deleteTask() exists
- Deletion logic exists
- `tests/task-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for deleteTask may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies deletion behavior.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review TaskService.deleteTask() implementation
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/task-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createTempSqliteDb()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'deleteTask() returns true only when row deleted'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other update tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test database
  - [ ] Use `createTempSqliteDb()` helper in `beforeAll`
  - [ ] Run migrations to set up schema
- [ ] Step 3: Test deletion
  - [ ] Test case 1: Create test task, call `deleteTask()` with task ID
  - [ ] Verify true is returned
  - [ ] Verify task is deleted from database
  - [ ] Test case 2: Call `deleteTask()` with non-existent ID
  - [ ] Verify false is returned
- [ ] Step 4: Verify deletion
  - [ ] Assert true is returned when row deleted
  - [ ] Assert false is returned when no row deleted

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: True when deleted
  - Acceptance: deleteTask() returns true when row is deleted
- [ ] Requirement 2: False when not deleted
  - Acceptance: deleteTask() returns false when no row deleted
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/task-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining deletion behavior

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify deletion works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 12: Persistence & Migrations
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-12.2.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-12.2.3, TASK-1.1.2, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Should return true only when row is deleted
  - Should return false when no row deleted
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-12.2.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-12.2.3
- Next: TASK-12.2.5
- Dependencies: TASK-12.2.3, TASK-1.1.2, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-12.2: TaskService - Update Operations (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/task-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Deletion behavior is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want deletion to return true/false so I know if deletion succeeded
- As a **client**, I want deletion feedback so I can handle deletion results

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies deleteTask() returns true only when row deleted
- Test passes
- All tests pass

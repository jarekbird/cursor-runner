# TASK-10.5.1: Test CursorCLI command is killed when output exceeds CURSOR_CLI_MAX_OUTPUT_SIZE

**Section**: 10. CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
**Subsection**: 10.5.1
**Task ID**: TASK-10.5.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-10.5

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorCLI.executeCommand()` kills the command when output exceeds `CURSOR_CLI_MAX_OUTPUT_SIZE`. This ensures output size limits are enforced.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-cli.ts` (executeCommand method, output size limit enforcement)

## Current State

- CursorCLI.executeCommand() exists
- Output size limit enforcement exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts` exists
- Test for output size limit may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies output size limit enforcement.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorCLI.executeCommand() implementation
- [ ] Review output size limit configuration
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'command is killed when output exceeds CURSOR_CLI_MAX_OUTPUT_SIZE'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for CursorCLI Output Size Limits tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test environment
  - [ ] Set `CURSOR_CLI_MAX_OUTPUT_SIZE` to a small test value (e.g., 1000 bytes)
  - [ ] Use `beforeEach` to save original value
  - [ ] Use `afterEach` to restore original value
- [ ] Step 3: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `child_process.spawn` to simulate command with large output
  - [ ] Track when process is killed
- [ ] Step 4: Test output size limit
  - [ ] Call `executeCommand()` with test command
  - [ ] Simulate output that exceeds MAX_OUTPUT_SIZE
  - [ ] Verify process is killed
  - [ ] Verify kill() is called on process
- [ ] Step 5: Verify size limit enforcement
  - [ ] Assert process is killed when limit is exceeded
  - [ ] Assert kill happens at correct size threshold

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Command is killed
  - Acceptance: Process is killed when output exceeds limit
  - Acceptance: kill() is called on process
- [ ] Requirement 2: Limit is enforced
  - Acceptance: Kill happens at correct size threshold
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Env var is restored after test

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Output exactly at limit (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify size limit enforcement works correctly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining output size limit

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify size limit enforcement works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 10: CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-10.4.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-10.4.3, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Output size limits protect against memory issues
  - Commands should be killed when limit is exceeded
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-10.4.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-10.4.3
- Next: TASK-10.5.2
- Dependencies: TASK-10.4.3, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-10.5: CursorCLI - Output Size Limits (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Size limit enforcement is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want output size limits so commands don't consume excessive memory
- As a **system**, I want size limits so I don't run out of memory

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies command is killed when output exceeds limit
- Test passes
- All tests pass

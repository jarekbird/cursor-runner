# TASK-6.1.6: Test GET /api/agent/list applies sorting correctly

**Section**: 6. HTTP Server - Agent Conversation API
**Subsection**: 6.1.6
**Task ID**: TASK-6.1.6
**Parent Task**: TASK-6.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `GET /api/agent/list` applies sorting correctly based on `sortBy` and `sortOrder` query parameters. This ensures conversations are returned in the correct order.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (GET /api/agent/list endpoint), `src/agent-conversation-service.ts` (listConversations method with sorting)

## Current State

- GET /api/agent/list endpoint exists
- Sorting logic exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/agent-conversation-api.integration.test.ts` exists
- Test for sorting may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies sorting functionality.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review GET /api/agent/list endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review AgentConversationService.listConversations() sorting logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/agent-conversation-api.integration.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'GET /api/agent/list applies sorting correctly'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other /api/agent/list tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `agentConversationService.listConversations()` to return test conversations in different orders
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test endpoint with sorting
  - [ ] Test case 1: Make GET request to `/api/agent/list?sortBy=createdAt&sortOrder=asc`
  - [ ] Verify conversations are sorted by createdAt ascending
  - [ ] Test case 2: Make GET request to `/api/agent/list?sortBy=createdAt&sortOrder=desc`
  - [ ] Verify conversations are sorted by createdAt descending
  - [ ] Test case 3: Test with different sortBy fields (e.g., updatedAt, id)
- [ ] Step 4: Verify sorting
  - [ ] Assert conversations are in correct order
  - [ ] Assert sortBy field is respected
  - [ ] Assert sortOrder is respected

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Sorting is applied correctly
  - Acceptance: Conversations are sorted by specified field
  - Acceptance: Sort order (asc/desc) is respected
- [ ] Requirement 2: Multiple sort fields work
  - Acceptance: Different sortBy values work correctly
  - Acceptance: Sorting is consistent
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Default sorting when sortBy/sortOrder not provided
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: Sorting with equal values (should be stable)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/agent-conversation-api.integration.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify sorting works correctly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining sorting behavior
- [ ] Document default sorting behavior

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify sorting works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 6: HTTP Server - Agent Conversation API
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-6.1.5
- **Dependencies**: TASK-6.1.5, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Sorting should be consistent
  - Default sorting should be documented
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-6.1.5

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-6.1.5
- Next: TASK-6.2.1
- Dependencies: TASK-6.1.5, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6

  - TASK-6.1: GET /api/agent/list (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/agent-conversation-api.integration.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Sorting is verified (asc and desc for multiple fields)
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want sorting to work so conversations are displayed in the right order
- As a **client**, I want sorting so I can organize conversations by different criteria

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies sorting by createdAt asc
- Test verifies sorting by createdAt desc
- Test verifies sorting by other fields
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-10.6.1: Test CursorCLI extractFilesFromOutput extracts files from various cursor-cli output formats

**Section**: 10. CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
**Subsection**: 10.6.1
**Task ID**: TASK-10.6.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-10.6

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorCLI.extractFilesFromOutput()` extracts files from various cursor-cli output formats. This ensures file extraction works for different output patterns.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-cli.ts` (extractFilesFromOutput method)

## Current State

- CursorCLI.extractFilesFromOutput() exists
- File extraction patterns exist (or need to be implemented)
- `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts` exists
- Test for file extraction may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies file extraction from output.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorCLI.extractFilesFromOutput() implementation
- [ ] Review file extraction patterns
- [ ] Review cursor-cli output formats
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'extractFilesFromOutput extracts files from various cursor-cli output formats'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for CursorCLI extractFilesFromOutput tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test data
  - [ ] Create test output strings with various file patterns
  - [ ] Include different cursor-cli output formats
- [ ] Step 3: Test file extraction
  - [ ] Test case 1: Extract files from standard format
  - [ ] Test case 2: Extract files from alternative format
  - [ ] Test case 3: Extract files from multiple formats in same output
  - [ ] Verify extracted files match expected patterns
- [ ] Step 4: Verify extraction
  - [ ] Assert files are extracted correctly
  - [ ] Assert extraction works for all formats

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Files are extracted
  - Acceptance: Files are extracted from various output formats
  - Acceptance: Extracted files match expected patterns
- [ ] Requirement 2: Extraction is reliable
  - Acceptance: Extraction works consistently
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Files with special characters (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining file extraction patterns

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify file extraction works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 10: CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-10.5.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-10.5.2, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - File extraction should work for various formats
  - Patterns should be reliable
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-10.5.2

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. File extraction is verified for various formats
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)

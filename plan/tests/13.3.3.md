# TASK-13.3.3: Test isElevenLabsCallbackUrl() detects ElevenLabs URLs

**Section**: 13. System Settings, Gmail MCP, Feature Flags
**Subsection**: 13.3.3
**Task ID**: TASK-13.3.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-13.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `isElevenLabsCallbackUrl()` correctly detects ElevenLabs URLs. This ensures URL detection works correctly for callback suppression.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/feature-flags.ts` (isElevenLabsCallbackUrl method)

## Current State

- isElevenLabsCallbackUrl() exists
- URL detection logic exists
- `tests/feature-flags.test.ts` exists
- Test for URL detection may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies ElevenLabs URL detection.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review isElevenLabsCallbackUrl() implementation
- [ ] Review URL detection patterns
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/feature-flags.test.ts`

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'isElevenLabsCallbackUrl() detects ElevenLabs URLs'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other ElevenLabs tests
- [ ] Step 2: Test URL detection
  - [ ] Test case 1: Call with ElevenLabs URL - verify true
  - [ ] Test case 2: Call with non-ElevenLabs URL - verify false
  - [ ] Test case 3: Call with various ElevenLabs URL formats - verify all detected
- [ ] Step 3: Verify detection
  - [ ] Assert ElevenLabs URLs are detected
  - [ ] Assert non-ElevenLabs URLs are not detected

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: ElevenLabs URLs are detected
  - Acceptance: Returns true for ElevenLabs URLs
  - Acceptance: Detection is accurate
- [ ] Requirement 2: Non-ElevenLabs URLs are not detected
  - Acceptance: Returns false for other URLs
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/feature-flags.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining URL detection

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify URL detection works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 13: System Settings, Gmail MCP, Feature Flags
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-13.3.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-13.3.2
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - URL detection should be accurate
  - Should handle various URL formats
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-13.3.2

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/feature-flags.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. URL detection is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want URL detection so ElevenLabs callbacks are identified

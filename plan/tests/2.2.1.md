# TASK-2.2.1: Test initialize() calls validateConfig()

**Section**: 2. Core Application Lifecycle
**Subsection**: 2.2.1
**Task ID**: TASK-2.2.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-2.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `initialize()` calls `validateConfig()` as the first step in the initialization sequence. This ensures configuration validation happens before any other initialization steps.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/index.ts` (initialize method)

## Current State

- `initialize()` method exists in CursorRunner
- `validateConfig()` method exists
- `tests/index.test.ts` exists
- Test for initialize() call order may not exist yet

**Important**: This is the first step in verifying the initialization sequence.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `initialize()` implementation
- [ ] Review `validateConfig()` method
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Understand how to spy on methods

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'initialize() calls validateConfig()'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for initialize() tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Create CursorRunner instance
  - [ ] Use `jest.spyOn` to spy on `validateConfig` method
  - [ ] Mock other dependencies to prevent actual execution
- [ ] Step 3: Test initialization
  - [ ] Call `initialize()` method
  - [ ] Verify `validateConfig` was called
  - [ ] Verify `validateConfig` was called before other methods
- [ ] Step 4: Verify call order
  - [ ] Use Jest's call tracking to verify order
  - [ ] Assert `validateConfig` is called first (or early in sequence)

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: validateConfig is called during initialize
  - Acceptance: Spy confirms validateConfig was called
  - Acceptance: Call happens during initialize execution
- [ ] Requirement 2: validateConfig is called early in sequence
  - Acceptance: validateConfig is called before other initialization steps
  - Acceptance: Call order is verified
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Mocks are properly cleaned up

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: validateConfig throws
  - Verify initialize handles validation errors (may be separate test)
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: validateConfig is called multiple times
  - Verify it's only called once (if that's expected)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:unit`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining what is being tested
- [ ] Document expected call order

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify validateConfig is called
- [ ] Verify call order is correct
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: Core Application Lifecycle
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-2.1.4
- **Dependencies**: TASK-2.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Use jest.spyOn for method tracking
  - Mock other dependencies to isolate this test
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-2.1.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/index.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. validateConfig call is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want to verify validateConfig is called so I know config is validated during init
- As a **system**, I want config validated first so I fail fast if config is invalid

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies validateConfig is called
- Test verifies call order
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-5.2.1: Test POST /api/new creates conversation with queueType='api' by default

**Section**: 5. HTTP Server - Conversation API
**Subsection**: 5.2.1
**Task ID**: TASK-5.2.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-5.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `POST /api/new` creates a conversation with `queueType='api'` by default when no queueType is provided. This ensures the API endpoint uses the correct default queue type.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /api/new endpoint), `src/conversation-service.ts` (forceNewConversation method)

## Current State

- POST /api/new endpoint exists
- Default queueType handling exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for default queueType may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies default queueType for API endpoint.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /api/new endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'POST /api/new creates conversation with queueType=api by default'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for /api/new endpoint tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `conversationService.forceNewConversation()` to track queueType parameter
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test conversation creation without queueType
  - [ ] Make POST request to `/api/new` with body: `{}` (no queueType)
  - [ ] Verify forceNewConversation() was called with queueType: 'api'
  - [ ] Verify response is successful
- [ ] Step 4: Verify default queue type
  - [ ] Assert forceNewConversation() receives queueType: 'api'
  - [ ] Assert default is correct for API endpoint

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Default queueType is 'api'
  - Acceptance: forceNewConversation() is called with queueType: 'api' when not provided
  - Acceptance: Default value is correct
- [ ] Requirement 2: Conversation is created
  - Acceptance: forceNewConversation() is called
  - Acceptance: Conversation ID is returned
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining default queueType

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify default queueType is correct
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 5: HTTP Server - Conversation API
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-5.1.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-5.1.2, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - API endpoint should default to 'api' queue type
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-5.1.2

## Related Tasks

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Default queueType is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want default queueType='api' so API requests use the correct queue
- As a **client**, I want sensible defaults so requests are simpler

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies default queueType='api' is used
- Test passes
- All tests pass

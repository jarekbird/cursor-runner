# TASK-12.2.5: Test TaskService.close() closes DB and allows re-open

**Section**: 12. Persistence & Migrations
**Subsection**: 12.2.5
**Task ID**: TASK-12.2.5
**Parent Task**: TASK-12.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `TaskService.close()` closes the database connection and allows the database to be re-opened. This ensures proper cleanup and reconnection.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/task-service.ts` (close method)

## Current State

- TaskService.close() exists
- Database closing exists
- `tests/task-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for close may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies database cleanup and reconnection.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review TaskService.close() implementation
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/task-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createTempSqliteDb()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'close() closes DB and allows re-open'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other update tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test database
  - [ ] Use `createTempSqliteDb()` helper in `beforeAll`
  - [ ] Run migrations to set up schema
- [ ] Step 3: Test database closing
  - [ ] Call `close()` on TaskService
  - [ ] Verify database connection is closed
  - [ ] Verify operations fail after close
- [ ] Step 4: Test re-opening
  - [ ] Create new TaskService instance with same database
  - [ ] Verify database can be re-opened
  - [ ] Verify operations work after re-open
- [ ] Step 5: Verify cleanup and reconnection
  - [ ] Assert database is closed
  - [ ] Assert database can be re-opened

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Database is closed
  - Acceptance: close() closes database connection
  - Acceptance: Operations fail after close
- [ ] Requirement 2: Database can be re-opened
  - Acceptance: New instance can open same database
  - Acceptance: Operations work after re-open
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/task-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining database cleanup

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify cleanup and reconnection work correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 12: Persistence & Migrations
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-12.2.4
- **Dependencies**: TASK-12.2.4, TASK-1.1.2, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Database should be properly closed
  - Database should be re-openable
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-12.2.4

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-12.2.4
- Next: TASK-12.3.1
- Dependencies: TASK-12.2.4, TASK-1.1.2, TASK-1.1.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/task-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Database cleanup is verified
4. Reconnection is verified
5. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
6. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
7. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want database cleanup so resources are freed
- As a **system**, I want reconnection so I can reuse databases

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies close() closes DB and allows re-open
- Test passes
- All tests pass

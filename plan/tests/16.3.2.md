# TASK-16.3.2: Update jest.config.js coverage thresholds

**Section**: 16. Shell Script Integration & CI
**Subsection**: 16.3.2
**Task ID**: TASK-16.3.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-16.3

## Description

Update `jest.config.js` to raise coverage thresholds gradually (e.g., `lines: 75, branches: 70, functions: 75, statements: 75`), exclude `index.ts` from coverage requirements, and verify coverage report is generated.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/jest.config.js`

## Current State

- `jest.config.js` exists
- Coverage configuration may exist
- Coverage thresholds may need updates

**Important**: This task ensures coverage enforcement.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review current `jest.config.js` configuration
- [ ] Review current coverage thresholds
- [ ] Review coverage report generation

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Update coverage thresholds
  - [ ] Set `lines: 75`
  - [ ] Set `branches: 70`
  - [ ] Set `functions: 75`
  - [ ] Set `statements: 75`
- [ ] Step 2: Exclude index.ts
  - [ ] Add `index.ts` to coverage exclusions
- [ ] Step 3: Verify coverage report
  - [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage`
  - [ ] Verify coverage report is generated
  - [ ] Verify thresholds are enforced

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Thresholds are set
  - Acceptance: Coverage thresholds are configured
  - Acceptance: Thresholds are reasonable
- [ ] Requirement 2: index.ts is excluded
  - Acceptance: index.ts doesn't count toward coverage
- [ ] Requirement 3: Report is generated
  - Acceptance: Coverage report is created

### Testing

- [ ] Update `jest.config.js`
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage`
- [ ] Verify coverage report is generated
- [ ] Verify thresholds are enforced
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`

### Documentation

- [ ] Add comments explaining coverage thresholds

### Verification

- [ ] Verify coverage configuration works
- [ ] Verify thresholds are enforced

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. jest.config.js is updated
2. Coverage thresholds are set
3. Coverage report is generated
4. All checks pass
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message

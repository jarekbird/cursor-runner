# TASK-17.1.2: Verify tests run in all repos

**Section**: 17. Cross-Repo Strategy
**Subsection**: 17.1.2
**Task ID**: TASK-17.1.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-17.1

## Description

Verify that tests can run in all cursor-runner repos (`assistant-integrations/cursor-runner` and `python-cursor/cursor-runner`). Ensure they can run the same test suite. Document any differences.

**Reference Implementation**: Other repos: `assistant-integrations/cursor-runner`, `python-cursor/cursor-runner`

## Current State

- Tests exist in current repo
- Other repos may exist
- Test compatibility may not be verified

**Important**: This task verifies cross-repo test compatibility.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review other cursor-runner repos
- [ ] Understand test requirements
- [ ] Check for differences in dependencies

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Check other repos
  - [ ] Verify `assistant-integrations/cursor-runner` exists
  - [ ] Verify `python-cursor/cursor-runner` exists
  - [ ] Check if tests can be copied/synced
- [ ] Step 2: Test compatibility
  - [ ] Attempt to run tests in other repos
  - [ ] Identify any compatibility issues
  - [ ] Document differences
- [ ] Step 3: Document differences
  - [ ] Document any repo-specific differences
  - [ ] Document any required adaptations
- [ ] Step 4: Verify tests run
  - [ ] Assert tests can run in all repos
  - [ ] Assert differences are documented

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Tests are compatible
  - Acceptance: Tests can run in all repos
  - Acceptance: Compatibility issues are resolved
- [ ] Requirement 2: Differences are documented
  - Acceptance: All differences are documented
- [ ] Requirement 3: Verification is complete
  - Acceptance: All repos are verified

### Testing

- [ ] Verify tests in other repos
- [ ] Document differences
- [ ] Verify documentation is complete

### Documentation

- [ ] Document compatibility status
- [ ] Document any differences
- [ ] Document required adaptations

### Verification

- [ ] Verify tests run in all repos
- [ ] Verify differences are documented

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Tests are verified in all repos
2. Differences are documented
3. All checks pass
4. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
5. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want verified compatibility so tests work in all repos
- As a **team**, I want documented differences so we understand variations

**Automated Tests**:
- Tests are verified to run in all repos
- Differences are documented

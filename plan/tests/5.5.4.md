# TASK-5.5.4: Test POST /api/:conversationId/message returns 200 immediately

**Section**: 5. HTTP Server - Conversation API
**Subsection**: 5.5.4
**Task ID**: TASK-5.5.4
**Parent Task**: TASK-5.5

## Description

Write a test to verify that `POST /api/:conversationId/message` returns 200 status code immediately when the request is valid, before background processing completes. This ensures the message endpoint responds quickly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /api/:conversationId/message endpoint)

## Current State

- POST /api/:conversationId/message endpoint exists
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for immediate response may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies the message endpoint responds immediately.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /api/:conversationId/message endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'POST /api/:conversationId/message returns 200 immediately'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other /api/:conversationId/message tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `conversationService.getConversationById()` to return test conversation
  - [ ] Mock `cursorExecution.iterate()` to simulate slow execution
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test message endpoint
  - [ ] Make POST request to `/api/test-conversation-id/message` with body: `{ message: 'test message' }`
  - [ ] Verify response status is 200 immediately (before iterate() completes)
  - [ ] Verify response indicates request was accepted
- [ ] Step 4: Verify immediate response
  - [ ] Assert response is received quickly
  - [ ] Assert response doesn't wait for iterate() to complete
  - [ ] Use `assertSuccessResponse()` helper

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Response is immediate
  - Acceptance: HTTP response is received before iterate() completes
  - Acceptance: Response time is fast
- [ ] Requirement 2: Response status is 200
  - Acceptance: HTTP status code is 200
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify response is immediate
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining async behavior

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify immediate response behavior
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 5: HTTP Server - Conversation API
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-5.5.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-5.5.3, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Message endpoint should respond immediately
  - Background processing happens after response
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-5.5.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-5.5.3
- Next: TASK-5.5.5
- Dependencies: TASK-5.5.3, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6

  - TASK-5.5: POST /api/:conversationId/message (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Immediate response is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want immediate responses from message endpoint so I don't block waiting
- As a **client**, I want fast responses so I can continue processing

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies 200 response is immediate
- Test verifies response doesn't wait for iteration
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-9.5.3: Test CursorExecutionService.execute() adds messages to conversation

**Section**: 9. Execution Orchestration
**Subsection**: 9.5.3
**Task ID**: TASK-9.5.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-9.5

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorExecutionService.execute()` adds messages to the conversation. This ensures conversation message storage works correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (execute method, message storage), `src/conversation-service.ts` (addMessage method)

## Current State

- CursorExecutionService.execute() exists
- ConversationService.addMessage() exists
- `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for message storage may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies message storage functionality.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorExecutionService.execute() implementation
- [ ] Review ConversationService.addMessage() method
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` and `createMockRedisClient()` helpers

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'execute() adds messages to conversation'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other conversation integration tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `ConversationService.addMessage()` to track calls
- [ ] Step 3: Test execute() message storage
  - [ ] Call `execute()` with test request
  - [ ] Verify ConversationService.addMessage() was called
  - [ ] Verify addMessage() was called with correct parameters (role, content, conversationId)
  - [ ] Verify messages are stored correctly
- [ ] Step 4: Verify message storage
  - [ ] Assert addMessage() is called with correct role
  - [ ] Assert addMessage() is called with correct content
  - [ ] Assert addMessage() is called with correct conversation ID

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Messages are added
  - Acceptance: ConversationService.addMessage() is called
  - Acceptance: Messages are stored in conversation
- [ ] Requirement 2: Message parameters are correct
  - Acceptance: Role, content, and conversation ID are correct
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Multiple messages in sequence (verify all are stored)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining message storage

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify message storage works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 9: Execution Orchestration
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-9.5.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-9.5.2, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Messages should be added to correct conversation
  - Message parameters should be correct
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-9.5.2

- Previous: TASK-9.5.2
- Next: TASK-9.5.4
- Dependencies: TASK-9.5.2, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Message storage is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want messages stored so conversations are built up
- As a **system**, I want message storage so conversation history is maintained

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies messages are added to conversation
- Test passes
- All tests pass

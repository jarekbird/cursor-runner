# TASK-9.3.6: Test CursorExecutionService.iterate() updates iterations count in responses

**Section**: 9. Execution Orchestration
**Subsection**: 9.3.6
**Task ID**: TASK-9.3.6
**Parent Task**: TASK-9.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorExecutionService.iterate()` updates the `iterations` count in responses as iterations progress. This ensures iteration tracking works correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (iterate method, iterations tracking)

## Current State

- CursorExecutionService.iterate() exists
- Iterations tracking exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for iterations count tracking may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies iteration count tracking.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorExecutionService.iterate() implementation
- [ ] Review how iterations count is tracked
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` and `createMockCursorCLI()` helpers

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'iterate() updates iterations count in responses'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other execution flow tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `CursorCLI.executeCommand()` to return results that trigger iteration
  - [ ] Track iterations count in responses
- [ ] Step 3: Test iterate() iterations tracking
  - [ ] Call `iterate()` with maxIterations: 3
  - [ ] Verify each response includes iterations count
  - [ ] Verify iterations count increments: 1, 2, 3
  - [ ] Verify final response includes correct iterations count
- [ ] Step 4: Verify iterations tracking
  - [ ] Assert iterations count is included in each response
  - [ ] Assert iterations count increments correctly
  - [ ] Assert final iterations count matches number of iterations performed

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Iterations count is updated
  - Acceptance: Each response includes iterations count
  - Acceptance: Iterations count increments with each iteration
- [ ] Requirement 2: Iterations count is accurate
  - Acceptance: Iterations count matches actual number of iterations
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Single iteration (verify iterations count is 1)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify iterations tracking works correctly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining iterations tracking

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify iterations tracking works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 9: Execution Orchestration
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-9.3.5
- **Dependencies**: TASK-9.3.5, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Iterations count should be accurate
  - Count should increment with each iteration
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-9.3.5

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-9.3.5
- Next: TASK-9.4.1
- Dependencies: TASK-9.3.5, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6

  - TASK-9.3: CursorExecutionService - Execution Flows (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Iterations tracking is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want iterations count tracked so I know how many iterations occurred
- As a **client**, I want iterations count so I can track iteration progress

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies iterations count is updated in responses
- Test verifies count increments correctly
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-9.3.5: Test CursorExecutionService.iterate() respects maxIterations

**Section**: 9. Execution Orchestration
**Subsection**: 9.3.5
**Task ID**: TASK-9.3.5
**Parent Task**: TASK-9.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorExecutionService.iterate()` respects the `maxIterations` parameter and stops iterating when the limit is reached. This ensures iteration limits are enforced.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (iterate method, maxIterations handling)

## Current State

- CursorExecutionService.iterate() exists
- maxIterations handling exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for maxIterations enforcement may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies iteration limit enforcement.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorExecutionService.iterate() implementation
- [ ] Review how maxIterations is used
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` and `createMockCursorCLI()` helpers

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'iterate() respects maxIterations'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other execution flow tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `CursorCLI.executeCommand()` to return results that trigger iteration
  - [ ] Track number of iterations performed
- [ ] Step 3: Test iterate() with maxIterations
  - [ ] Call `iterate()` with maxIterations: 3
  - [ ] Verify iteration stops at maxIterations (3 iterations)
  - [ ] Verify no more iterations are performed after limit
- [ ] Step 4: Verify maxIterations enforcement
  - [ ] Assert exactly maxIterations iterations are performed
  - [ ] Assert iteration stops at limit

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: maxIterations is respected
  - Acceptance: Iteration stops at maxIterations limit
  - Acceptance: No more iterations are performed
- [ ] Requirement 2: Iteration count is correct
  - Acceptance: Number of iterations matches maxIterations
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: maxIterations is 1 (verify single iteration)
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: maxIterations is very large (verify limit is still enforced)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify maxIterations is enforced correctly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining maxIterations enforcement

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify maxIterations is enforced correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 9: Execution Orchestration
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-9.3.4
- **Dependencies**: TASK-9.3.4, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - maxIterations should be strictly enforced
  - Iteration should stop at limit
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-9.3.4

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-9.3.4
- Next: TASK-9.3.6
- Dependencies: TASK-9.3.4, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4
- Related:
  - TASK-9.3: CursorExecutionService - Execution Flows (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. maxIterations enforcement is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want maxIterations enforced so iterations don't run indefinitely
- As a **system**, I want iteration limits so I don't consume excessive resources

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies maxIterations is respected
- Test passes
- All tests pass

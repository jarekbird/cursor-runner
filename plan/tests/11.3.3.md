# TASK-11.3.3: Test ConversationService.addMessage() stores review-agent messages when debug enabled (DB)

**Section**: 11. Redis-based Conversation Services
**Subsection**: 11.3.3
**Task ID**: TASK-11.3.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-11.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `ConversationService.addMessage()` stores review-agent messages when debug is enabled via database setting. This ensures review-agent messages are stored when debug is on.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/conversation-service.ts` (addMessage method, debug flag from DB)

## Current State

- ConversationService.addMessage() exists
- Debug flag from DB exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/conversation-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for review-agent storage with DB debug may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies review-agent storage when debug is enabled via DB.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review ConversationService.addMessage() implementation
- [ ] Review how debug flag is read from database
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'addMessage() stores review-agent messages when debug enabled (DB)'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other message storage tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `isSystemSettingEnabled('debug')` to return true (from DB)
  - [ ] Track Redis operations
- [ ] Step 3: Test review-agent storage with DB debug
  - [ ] Call `addMessage()` with review-agent message
  - [ ] Verify message IS stored in Redis
  - [ ] Verify Redis operations are performed
  - [ ] Verify message structure is correct
- [ ] Step 4: Verify storage
  - [ ] Assert review-agent message is stored when debug enabled
  - [ ] Assert message is persisted correctly

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Review-agent messages are stored
  - Acceptance: Review-agent messages are stored when debug is enabled via DB
  - Acceptance: Redis operations are performed
- [ ] Requirement 2: Debug flag is checked from DB
  - Acceptance: isSystemSettingEnabled('debug') is called
  - Acceptance: DB value is used
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: DB unavailable (verify fallback to env)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining debug flag from DB

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify review-agent storage works when debug enabled via DB
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 11: Redis-based Conversation Services
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-11.3.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-11.3.2, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Debug flag should be checked from DB first
  - Review-agent messages should be stored when debug is enabled
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-11.3.2

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-11.3.2
- Next: TASK-11.3.4
- Dependencies: TASK-11.3.2, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-11.3: ConversationService - Message Storage (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Review-agent storage with DB debug is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want review-agent messages stored when debug is on so I can debug issues
- As a **system**, I want debug flag from DB so I can control storage behavior

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies review-agent messages are stored when debug enabled via DB
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-9.4.2: Test CursorExecutionService.callbackWebhook() sends error payload with partial output when command fails

**Section**: 9. Execution Orchestration
**Subsection**: 9.4.2
**Task ID**: TASK-9.4.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-9.4

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorExecutionService.callbackWebhook()` sends an error payload with partial output (stdout, stderr) when command execution fails. This ensures error callbacks contain all available information.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (callbackWebhook method, error payload structure)

## Current State

- CursorExecutionService.callbackWebhook() exists
- Error payload structure exists
- `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for error payload may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies error callback payload structure.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorExecutionService.callbackWebhook() implementation
- [ ] Review error payload structure definition
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'callbackWebhook() sends error payload with partial output when command fails'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other callback webhook tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock HTTP client (fetch or axios) to capture callback requests
  - [ ] Set up callback URL for testing
- [ ] Step 3: Test callbackWebhook() with error
  - [ ] Call `callbackWebhook()` with error result that includes stdout and stderr
  - [ ] Verify HTTP request is made to callback URL
  - [ ] Verify payload includes error information
  - [ ] Verify payload includes stdout and stderr from error
  - [ ] Verify payload structure matches ErrorCallbackResponse format
- [ ] Step 4: Verify error payload structure
  - [ ] Assert payload includes stdout field
  - [ ] Assert payload includes stderr field
  - [ ] Assert payload includes exitCode field
  - [ ] Assert payload includes error information

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Error payload is sent
  - Acceptance: HTTP request is made to callback URL
  - Acceptance: Payload contains error information
- [ ] Requirement 2: Payload includes partial output
  - Acceptance: Payload includes stdout from error
  - Acceptance: Payload includes stderr from error
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Error with empty stdout/stderr (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining error payload structure

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify error payload structure is correct
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 9: Execution Orchestration
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-9.4.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-9.4.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Error payload should include all available output
  - Payload should match ErrorCallbackResponse structure
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-9.4.1

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-9.4.1
- Next: TASK-9.4.3
- Dependencies: TASK-9.4.1, TASK-1.1.4
- Related:
  - TASK-9.4: CursorExecutionService - Callback Webhook (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Error payload structure is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want error payloads with partial output so I can debug failures
- As a **client**, I want error callbacks so I can handle execution failures

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies error payload includes partial output
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-9.1.3: Test CursorExecutionService.execute() returns error when workspace is not trusted

**Section**: 9. Execution Orchestration
**Subsection**: 9.1.3
**Task ID**: TASK-9.1.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-9.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorExecutionService.execute()` returns an error when the workspace is not trusted. This ensures security validation for workspace trust.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (execute method, workspace trust validation), `src/workspace-trust-service.ts` (isTrusted method)

## Current State

- CursorExecutionService.execute() exists
- WorkspaceTrustService.isTrusted() exists
- `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for workspace trust validation may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies workspace trust security validation.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorExecutionService.execute() implementation
- [ ] Review WorkspaceTrustService.isTrusted() method
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'execute() returns error when workspace is not trusted'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other repository validation tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `WorkspaceTrustService.isTrusted()` to return false for untrusted workspace
  - [ ] Mock `FilesystemService.exists()` to return true (repository exists)
  - [ ] Mock `GitService` if needed
- [ ] Step 3: Test execute() with untrusted workspace
  - [ ] Call `execute()` with request containing untrusted repository path
  - [ ] Verify error is returned
  - [ ] Verify error message indicates workspace is not trusted
- [ ] Step 4: Verify error response
  - [ ] Assert error response structure is correct
  - [ ] Assert error message is clear and security-focused

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Error is returned
  - Acceptance: execute() returns error response
  - Acceptance: Error indicates workspace is not trusted
- [ ] Requirement 2: Error message is clear
  - Acceptance: Error message indicates security concern
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining security validation

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify validation is correct
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 9: Execution Orchestration
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-9.1.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-9.1.2, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Workspace trust is a security feature
  - Untrusted workspaces should be rejected
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-9.1.2

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-9.1.2
- Next: TASK-9.2.1
- Dependencies: TASK-9.1.2, TASK-1.1.4
- Related:
  - TASK-9.1: CursorExecutionService - Repository Validation (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Validation is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want security validation so untrusted workspaces are rejected
- As a **system**, I want workspace trust checks so I don't execute in untrusted locations

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies error when workspace is not trusted
- Test passes
- All tests pass

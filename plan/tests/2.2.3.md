# TASK-2.2.3: Test initialize() calls GitHubAuthService.initialize()

**Section**: 2. Core Application Lifecycle
**Subsection**: 2.2.3
**Task ID**: TASK-2.2.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-2.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `initialize()` calls `GitHubAuthService.initialize()` during the initialization sequence. This ensures GitHub authentication is set up during startup.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/index.ts` (initialize method)

## Current State

- `initialize()` method exists
- `GitHubAuthService` exists
- `tests/index.test.ts` exists
- Test for GitHubAuthService initialization may not exist yet

**Important**: This verifies authentication setup happens during initialization.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `initialize()` implementation
- [ ] Review `GitHubAuthService.initialize()` method
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Understand GitHubAuthService structure

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'initialize() calls GitHubAuthService.initialize()'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other initialize() tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Create CursorRunner instance
  - [ ] Mock `GitHubAuthService` or spy on initialize method
  - [ ] Mock other dependencies
- [ ] Step 3: Test initialization
  - [ ] Call `initialize()` method
  - [ ] Verify `GitHubAuthService.initialize()` was called
  - [ ] Verify call happens after migrations (if testing full sequence)
- [ ] Step 4: Verify call order
  - [ ] Assert GitHubAuthService.initialize is called after migrations
  - [ ] Assert it's called before server.start()

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: GitHubAuthService.initialize is called
  - Acceptance: Method is called during initialize
  - Acceptance: Call is verified via spy or mock
- [ ] Requirement 2: Call order is correct
  - Acceptance: Called after migrations
  - Acceptance: Called before server.start()
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Mocks are properly cleaned up

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: GitHubAuthService.initialize throws
  - Verify initialize handles auth errors (may be separate test - TASK-2.4.1)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:unit`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining what is being tested
- [ ] Document expected call order

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify GitHubAuthService.initialize is called
- [ ] Verify call order is correct
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: Core Application Lifecycle
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-2.2.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-2.2.2
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Auth errors are handled in TASK-2.4.1
  - Focus on verifying call, not auth execution
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-2.2.2

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-2.2.2
- Next: TASK-2.2.4
- Dependencies: TASK-2.2.2

  - TASK-2.4.1: GitHubAuthService failure handling

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/index.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. GitHubAuthService.initialize call is verified
4. Call order is verified
5. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
6. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
7. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want to verify GitHubAuthService is initialized so I know auth is set up
- As a **system**, I want auth initialized during startup so authenticated requests work

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies GitHubAuthService.initialize is called
- Test verifies call order
- Test passes
- All tests pass

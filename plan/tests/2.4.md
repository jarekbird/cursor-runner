### Step 2.4: CursorRunner.initialize() - Critical Failure Handling
**Objective**: Ensure critical failures cause startup to fail.

This task has been broken down into granular subtasks:

1. [TASK-2.4.1](./2.4.1.md): Test initialize() fails when GitHubAuthService.initialize() throws
2. [TASK-2.4.2](./2.4.2.md): Test initialize() fails when cursorCLI.validate() throws

**Note**: Complete all subtasks in order (2.4.1 → 2.4.2). Each subtask is independently completable with its own Definition of Done.

**Original Tasks**:
1. Extend `tests/index.test.ts`:
   - Add test: `initialize()` fails when `GitHubAuthService.initialize()` throws
   - Add test: `initialize()` fails when `cursorCLI.validate()` throws
   - Verify errors are propagated and startup does not complete
   - Verify `server.start()` is NOT called on critical failures

**Tests**:
- Mock critical dependencies to throw
- Verify `initialize()` rejects with appropriate error
- Verify `server.start()` is never called

**Verification**:
- Tests pass and confirm fail-fast behavior
- Error messages are clear
- No resource leaks (server not started)

# TASK-12.3.2: Test MigrationRunner.ensureSchemaMigrationsTable() is idempotent

**Section**: 12. Persistence & Migrations
**Subsection**: 12.3.2
**Task ID**: TASK-12.3.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-12.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `MigrationRunner.ensureSchemaMigrationsTable()` is idempotent - calling it multiple times doesn't cause errors or duplicate tables. This ensures safe repeated calls.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/migrations/` (ensureSchemaMigrationsTable method)

## Current State

- MigrationRunner.ensureSchemaMigrationsTable() exists
- Idempotency exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/migrations.test.ts` exists
- Test for idempotency may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies idempotency.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review MigrationRunner.ensureSchemaMigrationsTable() implementation
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/migrations.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createTempSqliteDb()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'ensureSchemaMigrationsTable() is idempotent'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other migration tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test database
  - [ ] Use `createTempSqliteDb()` helper in `beforeAll`
- [ ] Step 3: Test idempotency
  - [ ] Call `ensureSchemaMigrationsTable()` first time
  - [ ] Verify table is created
  - [ ] Call `ensureSchemaMigrationsTable()` second time
  - [ ] Verify no error is thrown
  - [ ] Verify table still exists (not duplicated)
- [ ] Step 4: Verify idempotency
  - [ ] Assert no error on second call
  - [ ] Assert table exists (single instance)

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: No errors on repeated calls
  - Acceptance: Multiple calls don't throw errors
- [ ] Requirement 2: Table is not duplicated
  - Acceptance: Only one table exists
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/migrations.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining idempotency

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify idempotency works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 12: Persistence & Migrations
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-12.3.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-12.3.1, TASK-1.1.2, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Should be safe to call multiple times
  - Should not create duplicate tables
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-12.3.1

## Related Tasks

- Next: TASK-12.3.3
- Dependencies: TASK-12.3.1, TASK-1.1.2, TASK-1.1.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/migrations.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Idempotency is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want idempotent operations so I can call them safely multiple times
- As a **system**, I want idempotency so I don't create duplicate tables

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies ensureSchemaMigrationsTable() is idempotent
- Test passes
- All tests pass

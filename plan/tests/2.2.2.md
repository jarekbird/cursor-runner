# TASK-2.2.2: Test initialize() calls migrations

**Section**: 2. Core Application Lifecycle
**Subsection**: 2.2.2
**Task ID**: TASK-2.2.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-2.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `initialize()` calls `ensureSchemaMigrationsTable()` and `runMigrations()` during initialization. This ensures database migrations are run as part of the startup sequence.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/index.ts` (initialize method), `src/migrations/` (migration system)

## Current State

- `initialize()` method exists
- Migration system exists in `src/migrations/`
- `tests/index.test.ts` exists
- Test for migration calls may not exist yet

**Important**: This verifies database setup happens during initialization.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `initialize()` implementation
- [ ] Review migration system API
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Understand migration function signatures

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'initialize() calls migrations'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other initialize() tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Create CursorRunner instance
  - [ ] Use `jest.spyOn` to spy on `ensureSchemaMigrationsTable`
  - [ ] Use `jest.spyOn` to spy on `runMigrations`
  - [ ] Mock other dependencies
- [ ] Step 3: Test initialization
  - [ ] Call `initialize()` method
  - [ ] Verify `ensureSchemaMigrationsTable` was called
  - [ ] Verify `runMigrations` was called
  - [ ] Verify call order (ensureSchemaMigrationsTable before runMigrations)
- [ ] Step 4: Verify call order
  - [ ] Assert ensureSchemaMigrationsTable is called before runMigrations
  - [ ] Assert both are called after validateConfig (if testing full sequence)

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Both migration functions are called
  - Acceptance: ensureSchemaMigrationsTable is called
  - Acceptance: runMigrations is called
- [ ] Requirement 2: Call order is correct
  - Acceptance: ensureSchemaMigrationsTable is called before runMigrations
  - Acceptance: Migrations are called after validateConfig
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Mocks are properly cleaned up

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Migration functions throw
  - Verify initialize handles migration errors (may be separate test - TASK-2.3)
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: Migrations already run
  - Verify idempotency (may be separate test)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:unit`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining what is being tested
- [ ] Document expected call order

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify both migration functions are called
- [ ] Verify call order is correct
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: Core Application Lifecycle
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-2.2.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-2.2.1
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Migration errors are handled in TASK-2.3
  - Focus on verifying calls, not migration execution
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-2.2.1

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-2.2.1
- Next: TASK-2.2.3
- Dependencies: TASK-2.2.1
- Related:
  - TASK-2.2: CursorRunner.initialize() - Happy Path (parent task)
  - TASK-2.3: Migration Failure Handling (handles errors)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/index.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Migration function calls are verified
4. Call order is verified
5. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
6. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
7. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want to verify migrations are called so I know database is set up during init
- As a **system**, I want migrations run during startup so database schema is current

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies ensureSchemaMigrationsTable is called
- Test verifies runMigrations is called
- Test verifies call order
- Test passes
- All tests pass

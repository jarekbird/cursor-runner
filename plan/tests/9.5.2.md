# TASK-9.5.2: Test CursorExecutionService.execute() gets conversation ID from service when not provided

**Section**: 9. Execution Orchestration
**Subsection**: 9.5.2
**Task ID**: TASK-9.5.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-9.5

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorExecutionService.execute()` gets the conversation ID from ConversationService when it is not provided in the request. This ensures conversation ID resolution works correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (execute method, conversationId resolution), `src/conversation-service.ts` (getConversationId method)

## Current State

- CursorExecutionService.execute() exists
- ConversationService.getConversationId() exists
- `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for conversation ID resolution may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies conversation ID resolution from service.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorExecutionService.execute() implementation
- [ ] Review ConversationService.getConversationId() method
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` and `createMockRedisClient()` helpers

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'execute() gets conversation ID from service when not provided'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other conversation integration tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `ConversationService.getConversationId()` to return test conversation ID: 'resolved-conversation-id'
- [ ] Step 3: Test execute() without explicit conversationId
  - [ ] Call `execute()` with request that has no conversationId field
  - [ ] Verify ConversationService.getConversationId() was called
  - [ ] Verify resolved conversation ID is used
  - [ ] Verify messages are added to the resolved conversation
- [ ] Step 4: Verify ID resolution
  - [ ] Assert ConversationService.getConversationId() is called
  - [ ] Assert resolved conversation ID is used

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Conversation ID is resolved
  - Acceptance: ConversationService.getConversationId() is called
  - Acceptance: Resolved conversation ID is used
- [ ] Requirement 2: Conversation is used correctly
  - Acceptance: Messages are added to resolved conversation
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: New conversation is created when none exists (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining conversation ID resolution

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify conversation ID resolution works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 9: Execution Orchestration
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-9.5.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-9.5.1, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - ConversationService should be called when ID is not provided
  - Resolved ID should be used for message storage
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-9.5.1

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-9.5.1
- Next: TASK-9.5.3
- Dependencies: TASK-9.5.1, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Conversation ID resolution is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want conversation ID resolution so I don't have to provide it every time
- As a **system**, I want automatic conversation ID so execution is simpler

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies conversation ID is resolved from service
- Test passes
- All tests pass

### Step 1.2: Test Configuration & Coverage Setup
**Objective**: Ensure Jest configuration supports all test types and coverage reporting.

This task has been broken down into granular subtasks:

1. [TASK-1.2.1](./1.2.1.md): Update Jest Configuration for Coverage and Test Types
2. [TASK-1.2.2](./1.2.2.md): Add Test Scripts to package.json

**Note**: Complete subtasks in order (1.2.1 → 1.2.2). Each subtask is independently completable with its own Definition of Done.

**Original Tasks**:
1. Review and update `jest.config.js`:
   - Ensure `collectCoverageFrom` includes all `src/**/*.ts` files (excluding `index.ts` for now)
   - Add coverage thresholds (start conservative: `lines: 60, branches: 50, functions: 60, statements: 60`)
   - Verify `testMatch` pattern matches all test files
   - Add `testTimeout` if needed (default 5000ms may be too short for some integration tests)

2. Add npm scripts to `package.json`:
   - `test:unit` - runs only unit tests (fast, no external dependencies)
   - `test:integration` - runs integration tests (may use temp files/DBs)
   - `test:e2e` - runs E2E-lite tests
   - `test:all` - runs all tests
   - `test:watch` - watch mode for development

**Tests**:
- Run `npm test` and verify all existing tests pass
- Verify coverage report is generated
- Verify test scripts work correctly

**Verification**:
- All existing tests pass
- Coverage report generates successfully
- Test scripts execute without errors

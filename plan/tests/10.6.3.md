# TASK-10.6.3: Test CursorCLI extractFilesFromOutput handles multiple file patterns

**Section**: 10. CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
**Subsection**: 10.6.3
**Task ID**: TASK-10.6.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-10.6

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorCLI.extractFilesFromOutput()` handles multiple file patterns correctly, extracting all matching files. This ensures multiple files are extracted from output.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-cli.ts` (extractFilesFromOutput method)

## Current State

- CursorCLI.extractFilesFromOutput() exists
- Multiple pattern handling exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts` exists
- Test for multiple patterns may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies multiple file extraction.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorCLI.extractFilesFromOutput() implementation
- [ ] Review file extraction patterns
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'extractFilesFromOutput handles multiple file patterns'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other extractFilesFromOutput tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test data
  - [ ] Create test output string with multiple file patterns
  - [ ] Include files matching different patterns
- [ ] Step 3: Test multiple pattern extraction
  - [ ] Call `extractFilesFromOutput()` with output containing multiple files
  - [ ] Verify all files are extracted
  - [ ] Verify files match expected patterns
  - [ ] Verify no duplicates
- [ ] Step 4: Verify multiple extraction
  - [ ] Assert all files are extracted
  - [ ] Assert no duplicates
  - [ ] Assert extraction works for all patterns

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Multiple files are extracted
  - Acceptance: All matching files are extracted
  - Acceptance: Files from different patterns are included
- [ ] Requirement 2: No duplicates
  - Acceptance: Each file appears only once
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Same file appears multiple times (verify deduplication)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining multiple pattern handling

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify multiple file extraction works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 10: CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-10.6.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-10.6.2, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Multiple files should be extracted
  - Deduplication should prevent duplicates
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-10.6.2

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-10.6.2
- Next: TASK-11.1.1
- Dependencies: TASK-10.6.2, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Multiple pattern handling is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want multiple files extracted so I can track all created files
- As a **system**, I want multiple file extraction so I can process all file changes

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies multiple file patterns are handled
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-2.6.1: Test shutdown() calls server.stop()

**Section**: 2. Core Application Lifecycle
**Subsection**: 2.6.1
**Task ID**: TASK-2.6.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-2.6

## Description

Write a test to verify that `shutdown()` calls `server.stop()` during shutdown. This ensures the HTTP server is properly stopped during graceful shutdown.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/index.ts` (shutdown method), `src/server.ts` (Server.stop method)

## Current State

- `shutdown()` method exists in CursorRunner
- `Server.stop()` method exists
- `tests/index.test.ts` exists
- Test for shutdown() may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies server is stopped during shutdown.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `shutdown()` implementation
- [ ] Review `Server.stop()` method
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper from Phase 1.1

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'shutdown() calls server.stop()'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for shutdown tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Create CursorRunner instance with mocked server
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper or `jest.spyOn` on stop method
  - [ ] Mock server.stop() method
- [ ] Step 3: Test shutdown
  - [ ] Call `shutdown()` method
  - [ ] Verify `server.stop()` was called
  - [ ] Verify shutdown completes successfully
- [ ] Step 4: Verify call
  - [ ] Assert server.stop() is called exactly once
  - [ ] Assert shutdown completes without errors

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: server.stop is called
  - Acceptance: server.stop() is called during shutdown
  - Acceptance: Call is verified via spy or mock
- [ ] Requirement 2: Shutdown completes successfully
  - Acceptance: shutdown() completes without errors
  - Acceptance: No exceptions are thrown
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Mocks are properly cleaned up

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: server.stop throws
  - Verify shutdown handles server errors (may be separate test - TASK-2.6.4)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:unit`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify server.stop() is called
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining what is being tested

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify server.stop() is called
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: Core Application Lifecycle
- **Execution Timing**: Can be done after TASK-2.5.4
- **Dependencies**: TASK-1.1.4 (createMockServer helper)
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Server should be stopped during shutdown
  - Focus on verifying call, not server stop execution
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after Phase 1.1

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-2.5.4
- Next: TASK-2.6.2
- Dependencies: TASK-1.1.4
- Related:
  - TASK-2.6: CursorRunner.shutdown() (parent task)
  - TASK-2.6.4: shutdown() error handling

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/index.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. server.stop() call is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want to verify server stops during shutdown so I know resources are cleaned up
- As a **system**, I want server stopped during shutdown so no requests are accepted after shutdown

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies server.stop() is called
- Test passes
- All tests pass

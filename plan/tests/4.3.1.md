# TASK-4.3.1: Test POST /cursor/iterate happy path

**Section**: 4. HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
**Subsection**: 4.3.1
**Task ID**: TASK-4.3.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-4.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `POST /cursor/iterate` happy path returns the result from `cursorExecution.iterate()`. This ensures the synchronous iteration endpoint works correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /cursor/iterate endpoint), `src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (iterate method)

## Current State

- POST /cursor/iterate endpoint exists
- `cursorExecution.iterate()` exists
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for iterate endpoint may not exist yet

**Important**: This is the first iteration endpoint test and establishes the pattern.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /cursor/iterate endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review `cursorExecution.iterate()` method signature
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper from Phase 1.1

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'POST /cursor/iterate happy path'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for cursor/iterate endpoint tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `cursorExecution.iterate()` to return success: `{ status: 200, body: { result: 'success', iterations: 3 } }`
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test iterate endpoint
  - [ ] Make POST request to `/cursor/iterate` with test body: `{ prompt: 'test prompt' }`
  - [ ] Verify response status is 200
  - [ ] Verify response body matches iterate() return value
  - [ ] Verify iterate() was called with correct parameters
- [ ] Step 4: Verify response structure
  - [ ] Use `assertSuccessResponse()` helper
  - [ ] Verify response matches iterate() return structure
  - [ ] Verify response includes iterations count

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Response matches iterate() result
  - Acceptance: Response body matches iterate() return value
  - Acceptance: Response status matches iterate() status
- [ ] Requirement 2: iterate() is called correctly
  - Acceptance: iterate() is called with request body parameters
  - Acceptance: iterate() is called once
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Mocks are properly cleaned up

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Missing required body fields
  - Verify validation (may be separate test)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify iterate() is called correctly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining what is being tested
- [ ] Document expected request/response format

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify response matches expected contract
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 4: HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-4.2.6
- **Dependencies**: TASK-4.2.6, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Use test helpers from Phase 1.1
  - Mock cursorExecution.iterate() to return predictable values
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-4.2.6

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-4.2.6
- Next: TASK-4.3.2
- Dependencies: TASK-4.2.6, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6
- Related:
  - TASK-4.3: POST /cursor/iterate (Synchronous) (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. iterate() call and response are verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want to iterate cursor commands synchronously so I can get immediate results
- As a **client**, I want synchronous iteration so I can wait for results before proceeding

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies POST /cursor/iterate returns iterate() result
- Test verifies iterate() is called correctly
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-3.1.2: Test GET /health logs requester info

**Section**: 3. HTTP Server - Health & Diagnostics
**Subsection**: 3.1.2
**Task ID**: TASK-3.1.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-3.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `GET /health` logs requester information (IP address, user-agent) when the endpoint is called. This ensures request logging works correctly for the health endpoint.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (health endpoint, logging)

## Current State

- Health endpoint exists
- Logger is used throughout the codebase
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for requester logging may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies logging behavior for the health endpoint.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review health endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review how requester info is extracted (req.ip, req.get('user-agent'))
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Understand logger usage patterns

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'GET /health logs requester info'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other health endpoint tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Set up logger spy to capture log messages
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test health endpoint with logging
  - [ ] Make GET request to `/health` with custom headers (user-agent)
  - [ ] Verify logger was called
  - [ ] Verify log message contains IP address
  - [ ] Verify log message contains user-agent
- [ ] Step 4: Verify log content
  - [ ] Assert logger.info() or logger.debug() was called
  - [ ] Assert log message contains requester metadata
  - [ ] Assert metadata is correctly formatted

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Requester info is logged
  - Acceptance: Logger is called with requester information
  - Acceptance: IP address is included in log
  - Acceptance: User-agent is included in log
- [ ] Requirement 2: Log message is informative
  - Acceptance: Message contains requester metadata
  - Acceptance: Metadata is correctly extracted from request
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Logger spy is properly cleaned up

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: User-agent header is missing
  - Verify graceful handling (logs undefined or 'unknown')
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: IP address is not available
  - Verify graceful handling

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify requester info is logged
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining what is being tested
- [ ] Document expected log message format

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify requester info is logged
- [ ] Verify log message is informative
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 3: HTTP Server - Health & Diagnostics
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-3.1.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-3.1.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Logging should provide visibility without being too verbose
  - Focus on verifying key requester information
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-3.1.1

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-3.1.1
- Next: TASK-3.2.1
- Dependencies: TASK-3.1.1, TASK-1.1.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Requester info logging is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want requester info logged so I can debug health check requests
- As an **operator**, I want requester info logged so I can monitor health check usage

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies requester info is logged
- Test verifies IP and user-agent are captured
- Test passes
- All tests pass

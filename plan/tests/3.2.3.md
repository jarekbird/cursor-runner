# TASK-3.2.3: Test GET /health/queue has no warning when queue is healthy

**Section**: 3. HTTP Server - Health & Diagnostics
**Subsection**: 3.2.3
**Task ID**: TASK-3.2.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-3.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `GET /health/queue` has no `warning` field when the queue is healthy (available > 0 or waiting === 0). This ensures the warning only appears when appropriate.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (health/queue endpoint, warning logic)

## Current State

- Health/queue endpoint exists
- Warning logic exists
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for healthy queue case may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies warning doesn't appear when queue is healthy.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review health/queue endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review warning logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` and `createMockCursorCLI()` helpers

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'GET /health/queue has no warning when queue is healthy'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other health/queue tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `getQueueStatus()` to return healthy state: `{ available: 3, waiting: 0, maxConcurrent: 5 }`
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test queue endpoint without warning
  - [ ] Make GET request to `/health/queue`
  - [ ] Verify response status is 200
  - [ ] Verify response does NOT include `warning` field
  - [ ] Verify response still contains queue status
- [ ] Step 4: Verify no warning
  - [ ] Assert warning field is undefined or not present
  - [ ] Assert response is valid and contains queue status

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: No warning when queue is healthy
  - Acceptance: Response does not include `warning` field when available > 0
  - Acceptance: Response does not include `warning` field when waiting === 0
- [ ] Requirement 2: Response still contains queue status
  - Acceptance: Response includes queue status fields
  - Acceptance: Response is valid JSON
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Mocks are properly cleaned up

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: available === maxConcurrent (all slots available)
  - Verify no warning
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: available === 1 (one slot available)
  - Verify no warning

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify warning field is not present
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining when warning should not appear

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify warning logic is correct (no false positives)
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 3: HTTP Server - Health & Diagnostics
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-3.2.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-3.2.2, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Warning should only appear when truly needed
  - No false positives
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-3.2.2

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-3.2.2
- Next: TASK-4.1.1
- Dependencies: TASK-3.2.2, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-3.2: GET /health/queue Endpoint (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. No warning field is verified when queue is healthy
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want no warning when queue is healthy so I know the system is operating normally
- As a **monitoring system**, I want accurate warnings so I don't get false alerts

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies warning field is not present when queue is healthy
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-17.1.1: Document test sharing strategy

**Section**: 17. Cross-Repo Strategy
**Subsection**: 17.1.1
**Task ID**: TASK-17.1.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-17.1

## Description

Document the strategy for sharing or synchronizing tests across cursor-runner copies. Decide between symlinks, submodule, or manual sync. Create sync script if manual sync is chosen. Document the process for keeping tests in sync.

**Reference Implementation**: Other repos: `assistant-integrations/cursor-runner`, `python-cursor/cursor-runner`

## Current State

- Tests exist in current repo
- Other repos may exist
- Sharing strategy may not be documented

**Important**: This task documents cross-repo test sharing.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review other cursor-runner repos
- [ ] Understand current test structure
- [ ] Evaluate sharing options (symlinks, submodule, manual sync)

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Evaluate options
  - [ ] Consider symlinks approach
  - [ ] Consider submodule approach
  - [ ] Consider manual sync approach
  - [ ] Decide on best approach
- [ ] Step 2: Document strategy
  - [ ] Create documentation file explaining chosen strategy
  - [ ] Document pros/cons of chosen approach
  - [ ] Document process for keeping tests in sync
- [ ] Step 3: Create sync script (if manual sync)
  - [ ] Create script to sync tests between repos
  - [ ] Document script usage
- [ ] Step 4: Verify documentation
  - [ ] Verify strategy is clear
  - [ ] Verify process is documented

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Strategy is documented
  - Acceptance: Strategy is clearly explained
  - Acceptance: Process is documented
- [ ] Requirement 2: Sync process works
  - Acceptance: Sync script works (if applicable)
- [ ] Requirement 3: Documentation is complete
  - Acceptance: All aspects are documented

### Testing

- [ ] Create documentation
- [ ] Create sync script (if needed)
- [ ] Test sync process (if applicable)
- [ ] Verify documentation is clear

### Documentation

- [ ] Document strategy choice
- [ ] Document sync process
- [ ] Document any differences between repos

### Verification

- [ ] Verify strategy is documented
- [ ] Verify sync process works (if applicable)

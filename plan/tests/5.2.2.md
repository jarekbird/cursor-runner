# TASK-5.2.2: Test POST /api/new uses provided queueType from body

**Section**: 5. HTTP Server - Conversation API
**Subsection**: 5.2.2
**Task ID**: TASK-5.2.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-5.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `POST /api/new` uses the provided `queueType` value from the request body when it is specified. This ensures custom queue types work correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /api/new endpoint, queueType handling)

## Current State

- POST /api/new endpoint exists
- queueType handling exists
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for provided queueType may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies custom queue type handling.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /api/new endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'POST /api/new uses provided queueType from body'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other /api/new tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `conversationService.forceNewConversation()` to track queueType parameter
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test conversation creation with queueType
  - [ ] Make POST request to `/api/new` with body: `{ queueType: 'telegram' }`
  - [ ] Verify forceNewConversation() was called with queueType: 'telegram'
  - [ ] Verify response is successful
- [ ] Step 4: Verify queueType is used
  - [ ] Assert forceNewConversation() receives correct queueType value
  - [ ] Assert provided value overrides default

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Provided queueType is used
  - Acceptance: forceNewConversation() is called with provided queueType
  - Acceptance: Provided value overrides default
- [ ] Requirement 2: QueueType is passed correctly
  - Acceptance: queueType parameter is extracted from body
  - Acceptance: queueType is passed to forceNewConversation() method
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining queueType handling

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify queueType handling is correct
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 5: HTTP Server - Conversation API
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-5.2.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-5.2.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Provided value should override default
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-5.2.1

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-5.2.1
- Next: TASK-5.2.3
- Dependencies: TASK-5.2.1, TASK-1.1.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Provided queueType is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want to specify queueType so I can control which conversation queue is used
- As a **client**, I want to set queueType so I can organize conversations by source

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies provided queueType is used
- Test verifies value overrides default
- Test passes
- All tests pass

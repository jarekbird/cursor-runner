# TASK-11.2.1: Test ConversationService.createConversation() sets TTL and last-conversation key per queue

**Section**: 11. Redis-based Conversation Services
**Subsection**: 11.2.1
**Task ID**: TASK-11.2.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-11.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `ConversationService.createConversation()` sets TTL (time-to-live) and updates the last-conversation key per queue type. This ensures conversations expire and queue tracking works correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/conversation-service.ts` (createConversation method, TTL and last-conversation key handling)

## Current State

- ConversationService.createConversation() exists
- TTL handling exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/conversation-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for TTL and last-conversation key may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies conversation creation with TTL and queue tracking.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review ConversationService.createConversation() implementation
- [ ] Review TTL configuration
- [ ] Review last-conversation key structure
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'createConversation() sets TTL and last-conversation key per queue'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for ConversationService conversation management tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper
  - [ ] Track Redis set operations with TTL
  - [ ] Track last-conversation key updates
- [ ] Step 3: Test conversation creation
  - [ ] Call `createConversation()` with queueType: 'api'
  - [ ] Verify conversation is created in Redis
  - [ ] Verify TTL is set on conversation key
  - [ ] Verify last-conversation key for 'api' queue is updated
  - [ ] Verify TTL value is correct
- [ ] Step 4: Verify TTL and key updates
  - [ ] Assert TTL is set on conversation
  - [ ] Assert last-conversation key is updated
  - [ ] Assert queue-specific key is used

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: TTL is set
  - Acceptance: Conversation key has TTL set
  - Acceptance: TTL value is correct
- [ ] Requirement 2: Last-conversation key is updated
  - Acceptance: Last-conversation key for queue type is updated
  - Acceptance: Key contains new conversation ID
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: TTL is 0 or negative (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining TTL and last-conversation key behavior

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify TTL and key updates work correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 11: Redis-based Conversation Services
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-11.1.4
- **Dependencies**: TASK-11.1.4, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - TTL ensures conversations expire
  - Last-conversation key tracks most recent conversation per queue
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-11.1.4

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-11.1.4
- Next: TASK-11.2.2
- Dependencies: TASK-11.1.4, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-11.2: ConversationService - Conversation Management (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. TTL setting is verified
4. Last-conversation key update is verified
5. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
6. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
7. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want TTL set so conversations expire automatically
- As a **system**, I want last-conversation key updated so I can track recent conversations

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies TTL is set on conversation
- Test verifies last-conversation key is updated per queue
- Test passes
- All tests pass

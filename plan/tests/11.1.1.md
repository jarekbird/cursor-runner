# TASK-11.1.1: Test ConversationService.getConversationId() explicit conversationId is used and last-conversation key not updated

**Section**: 11. Redis-based Conversation Services
**Subsection**: 11.1.1
**Task ID**: TASK-11.1.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-11.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `ConversationService.getConversationId()` uses an explicit `conversationId` when provided and does not update the last-conversation key. This ensures explicit IDs take precedence.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/conversation-service.ts` (getConversationId method)

## Current State

- ConversationService.getConversationId() exists
- Last-conversation key handling exists
- `tests/conversation-service.test.ts` exists (or needs to be created)
- Test for explicit conversationId handling may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies explicit conversation ID usage.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review ConversationService.getConversationId() implementation
- [ ] Review last-conversation key structure
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'getConversationId() explicit conversationId is used and last-conversation key not updated'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for ConversationService getConversationId tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper
  - [ ] Set up Redis mock to track key operations
- [ ] Step 3: Test explicit conversationId
  - [ ] Call `getConversationId()` with explicit conversationId: 'test-id'
  - [ ] Verify explicit ID is returned
  - [ ] Verify last-conversation key is NOT updated
  - [ ] Verify Redis set operations don't include last-conversation key
- [ ] Step 4: Verify explicit ID usage
  - [ ] Assert explicit conversationId is returned
  - [ ] Assert last-conversation key is not modified

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Explicit ID is used
  - Acceptance: Provided conversationId is returned
  - Acceptance: getConversationId() doesn't query Redis for last-conversation
- [ ] Requirement 2: Last-conversation key is not updated
  - Acceptance: Last-conversation key is not set
  - Acceptance: Redis operations don't include last-conversation key
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Explicit ID is null/undefined (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining explicit ID handling

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify explicit ID usage works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 11: Redis-based Conversation Services
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-10.6.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-10.6.3, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Explicit IDs should take precedence
  - Last-conversation key should not be updated when explicit ID is provided
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-10.6.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-10.6.3
- Next: TASK-11.1.2
- Dependencies: TASK-10.6.3, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-11.1: ConversationService - getConversationId (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Explicit ID usage is verified
4. Last-conversation key behavior is verified
5. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
6. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
7. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want explicit conversationId used so I can control which conversation is used
- As a **system**, I want explicit IDs to take precedence so user intent is respected

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies explicit conversationId is used
- Test verifies last-conversation key is not updated
- Test passes
- All tests pass

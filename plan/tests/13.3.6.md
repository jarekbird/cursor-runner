# TASK-13.3.6: Test shouldSendElevenLabsCallback() masks secrets in logs

**Section**: 13. System Settings, Gmail MCP, Feature Flags
**Subsection**: 13.3.6
**Task ID**: TASK-13.3.6
**Parent Task**: TASK-13.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `shouldSendElevenLabsCallback()` masks secrets (API keys, tokens) in log messages. This ensures sensitive information is not exposed in logs.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/feature-flags.ts` (shouldSendElevenLabsCallback method, secret masking)

## Current State

- shouldSendElevenLabsCallback() exists
- Secret masking exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/feature-flags.test.ts` exists
- Test for secret masking may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies security - secret masking in logs.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review shouldSendElevenLabsCallback() implementation
- [ ] Review secret masking logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/feature-flags.test.ts`
- [ ] Use test environment setup and logger mocking

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'shouldSendElevenLabsCallback() masks secrets in logs'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other ElevenLabs tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test environment
  - [ ] Set up logger spy to capture log messages
  - [ ] Prepare test URL with secret/token (e.g., API key in query param)
- [ ] Step 3: Test secret masking
  - [ ] Call `shouldSendElevenLabsCallback()` with URL containing secret
  - [ ] Verify log message is captured
  - [ ] Verify secret is masked in log (e.g., replaced with '***' or similar)
  - [ ] Verify original secret is not in log
- [ ] Step 4: Verify secret masking
  - [ ] Assert secret is masked in log
  - [ ] Assert original secret is not exposed

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Secrets are masked
  - Acceptance: Secrets are replaced with mask in logs
  - Acceptance: Original secret is not in log
- [ ] Requirement 2: Masking is effective
  - Acceptance: Masked value doesn't reveal secret
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Multiple secrets in URL (verify all are masked)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/feature-flags.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining secret masking

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify secret masking works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 13: System Settings, Gmail MCP, Feature Flags
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-13.3.5
- **Dependencies**: TASK-13.3.5
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Secret masking is a security requirement
  - Logs should not expose sensitive information
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-13.3.5

## Related Tasks

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/feature-flags.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Secret masking is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want secret masking so sensitive data isn't exposed in logs
- As a **system**, I want security so logs don't leak secrets

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies secrets are masked in logs
- Test passes
- All tests pass

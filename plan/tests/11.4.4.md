# TASK-11.4.4: Test AgentConversationService.addMessage() adds message with ID and timestamp

**Section**: 11. Redis-based Conversation Services
**Subsection**: 11.4.4
**Task ID**: TASK-11.4.4
**Parent Task**: TASK-11.4

## Description

Write a test to verify that `AgentConversationService.addMessage()` adds a message with ID and timestamp to the conversation. This ensures messages are properly stored with metadata.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/agent-conversation-service.ts` (addMessage method)

## Current State

- AgentConversationService.addMessage() exists
- Message ID and timestamp handling exists
- `tests/agent-conversation-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for addMessage may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies message addition with metadata.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review AgentConversationService.addMessage() implementation
- [ ] Review message structure
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/agent-conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'addMessage() adds message with ID and timestamp'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other basic operations tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper
  - [ ] Set up test conversation in Redis mock
- [ ] Step 3: Test message addition
  - [ ] Call `addMessage()` with test message
  - [ ] Verify message is added to conversation
  - [ ] Verify message has ID
  - [ ] Verify message has timestamp
  - [ ] Verify message structure is correct
- [ ] Step 4: Verify message addition
  - [ ] Assert message is added
  - [ ] Assert message has ID
  - [ ] Assert message has timestamp

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Message is added
  - Acceptance: Message is added to conversation
  - Acceptance: Message is persisted
- [ ] Requirement 2: Message has metadata
  - Acceptance: Message has ID
  - Acceptance: Message has timestamp
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/agent-conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining message addition

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify message addition works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 11: Redis-based Conversation Services
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-11.4.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-11.4.3, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Messages should have ID and timestamp
  - Message structure should be consistent
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-11.4.3

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/agent-conversation-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Message addition is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want messages with ID and timestamp so I can track messages
- As a **system**, I want message metadata so I can manage message history

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies message is added with ID and timestamp
- Test passes
- All tests pass

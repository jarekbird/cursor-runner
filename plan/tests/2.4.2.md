# TASK-2.4.2: Test initialize() fails when cursorCLI.validate() throws

**Section**: 2. Core Application Lifecycle
**Subsection**: 2.4.2
**Task ID**: TASK-2.4.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-2.4

## Description

Write a test to verify that `initialize()` fails (throws/rejects) when `cursorCLI.validate()` throws an error. This ensures critical failures cause startup to fail fast.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/index.ts` (initialize method, error handling)

## Current State

- `initialize()` method exists
- `cursorCLI.validate()` exists
- `tests/index.test.ts` exists
- Test for cursorCLI validation failure may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies fail-fast behavior for critical CLI validation failures.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `initialize()` implementation
- [ ] Review cursorCLI.validate() method
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper from Phase 1.1

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'initialize() fails when cursorCLI.validate() throws'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other critical failure tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Create CursorRunner instance with mocked cursorCLI
  - [ ] Mock `cursorCLI.validate()` to throw an error
  - [ ] Mock other dependencies (migrations, GitHubAuthService, server)
  - [ ] Ensure mocks are set up so cursorCLI.validate() is reached
- [ ] Step 3: Test initialization failure
  - [ ] Call `initialize()` method
  - [ ] Verify initialize() throws/rejects with error
  - [ ] Verify error is propagated from cursorCLI.validate()
- [ ] Step 4: Verify startup doesn't complete
  - [ ] Verify `server.start()` is NOT called
  - [ ] Verify initialize() doesn't complete successfully
  - [ ] Verify error message is clear

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Initialize fails on critical error
  - Acceptance: initialize() throws/rejects when cursorCLI.validate() throws
  - Acceptance: Error is propagated correctly
- [ ] Requirement 2: Startup doesn't complete
  - Acceptance: server.start() is never called
  - Acceptance: No partial startup state
- [ ] Requirement 3: Error message is clear
  - Acceptance: Error message indicates cursorCLI validation failure
  - Acceptance: Error is actionable

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Error after some initialization steps
  - Verify no resource leaks (server not started)
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: Different error types from validate()
  - Verify various error types are handled correctly

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:unit`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify initialize() throws/rejects
- [ ] Verify server.start() is not called
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining fail-fast behavior
- [ ] Document why cursorCLI validation failures are critical

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify fail-fast behavior works
- [ ] Verify no resource leaks
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: Core Application Lifecycle
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-2.4.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-2.4.1, TASK-1.1.3 (createMockCursorCLI helper)
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - cursorCLI is critical - app can't run without it
  - Should fail fast to avoid partial startup state
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-2.4.1

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-2.4.1
- Next: TASK-2.5.1
- Dependencies: TASK-2.4.1, TASK-1.1.3
- Related:
  - TASK-2.4: CursorRunner.initialize() - Critical Failure Handling (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/index.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Fail-fast behavior is verified
4. server.start() not called is verified
5. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
6. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
7. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want startup to fail fast on CLI validation errors so I know immediately if cursor-cli is unavailable
- As a **system**, I want to avoid partial startup states so I don't run in a broken condition

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies initialize() fails when cursorCLI.validate() throws
- Test verifies server.start() is not called
- Test verifies error is propagated
- Test passes
- All tests pass

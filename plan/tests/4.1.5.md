# TASK-4.1.5: Test POST /cursor/execute generates requestId when not provided

**Section**: 4. HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
**Subsection**: 4.1.5
**Task ID**: TASK-4.1.5
**Parent Task**: TASK-4.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `POST /cursor/execute` generates a `requestId` when it is not provided in the request body. This ensures every execution has a unique identifier.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /cursor/execute endpoint, requestId generation)

## Current State

- POST /cursor/execute endpoint exists
- requestId generation exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for requestId generation may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies automatic requestId generation.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /cursor/execute endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review how requestId is generated (UUID or similar)
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'POST /cursor/execute generates requestId when not provided'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other cursor/execute tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `cursorExecution.execute()` to track requestId parameter
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test execute endpoint without requestId
  - [ ] Make POST request to `/cursor/execute` with body: `{ prompt: 'test' }` (no requestId)
  - [ ] Verify execute() was called with a requestId
  - [ ] Verify requestId is a valid format (UUID or similar)
  - [ ] Verify response is successful
- [ ] Step 4: Verify requestId generation
  - [ ] Assert requestId is generated
  - [ ] Assert requestId format is correct
  - [ ] Assert requestId is unique (test multiple requests)

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: requestId is generated when missing
  - Acceptance: execute() is called with a requestId when not provided
  - Acceptance: requestId is generated automatically
- [ ] Requirement 2: requestId format is valid
  - Acceptance: requestId matches expected format (UUID, timestamp-based, etc.)
  - Acceptance: requestId is unique per request
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Mocks are properly cleaned up

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: requestId is provided
  - Verify provided requestId is used (not generated)
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: requestId is empty string
  - Verify empty string is treated as missing (generates new one)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify requestId generation works correctly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining requestId generation
- [ ] Document requestId format

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify requestId generation is correct
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 4: HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-4.1.4
- **Dependencies**: TASK-4.1.4, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - requestId should be unique for each execution
  - Format should be consistent and parseable
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-4.1.4

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-4.1.4
- Next: TASK-4.2.1
- Dependencies: TASK-4.1.4, TASK-1.1.4
- Related:
  - TASK-4.1: POST /cursor/execute (Synchronous) (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. requestId generation is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want automatic requestId generation so I don't have to provide it manually
- As a **system**, I want unique requestIds so I can track each execution

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies requestId is generated when not provided
- Test verifies requestId format is valid
- Test passes
- All tests pass

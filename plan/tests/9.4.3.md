# TASK-9.4.3: Test CursorExecutionService.callbackWebhook() logs HTTP errors but doesn't throw

**Section**: 9. Execution Orchestration
**Subsection**: 9.4.3
**Task ID**: TASK-9.4.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-9.4

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorExecutionService.callbackWebhook()` logs HTTP errors but doesn't throw exceptions when the callback webhook fails. This ensures callback failures don't crash the system.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (callbackWebhook method, error handling)

## Current State

- CursorExecutionService.callbackWebhook() exists
- Error handling exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for HTTP error handling may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies graceful handling of callback failures.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorExecutionService.callbackWebhook() implementation
- [ ] Review error handling logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'callbackWebhook() logs HTTP errors but doesn't throw'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other callback webhook tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock HTTP client (fetch or axios) to throw error or return error response
  - [ ] Set up logger spy to capture log messages
- [ ] Step 3: Test callbackWebhook() with HTTP error
  - [ ] Call `callbackWebhook()` with test payload
  - [ ] Verify HTTP error is logged
  - [ ] Verify no exception is thrown
  - [ ] Verify system continues to operate normally
- [ ] Step 4: Verify error handling
  - [ ] Assert error is logged
  - [ ] Assert no exception is propagated
  - [ ] Assert system continues operating

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: HTTP errors are logged
  - Acceptance: Logger is called with error information
  - Acceptance: Error message is clear
- [ ] Requirement 2: System doesn't crash
  - Acceptance: No exception is thrown
  - Acceptance: System continues to operate
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Network timeout (verify handling)
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: HTTP error status (4xx, 5xx) (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining error handling

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify graceful error handling works
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 9: Execution Orchestration
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-9.4.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-9.4.2, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Callback failures shouldn't crash the system
  - Errors should be logged for debugging
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-9.4.2

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-9.4.2
- Next: TASK-9.5.1
- Dependencies: TASK-9.4.2, TASK-1.1.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Error logging is verified
4. No crash behavior is verified
5. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
6. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
7. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want callback errors logged so I can debug callback issues
- As a **system**, I want to handle callback failures gracefully so I don't crash

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies HTTP errors are logged
- Test verifies system doesn't crash on callback failure
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-14.1.4: Test GitService.ensureRepositoriesDirectory() is idempotent

**Section**: 14. Filesystem & Workspace Services
**Subsection**: 14.1.4
**Task ID**: TASK-14.1.4
**Parent Task**: TASK-14.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `GitService.ensureRepositoriesDirectory()` is idempotent - calling it multiple times doesn't cause errors or duplicate operations. This ensures safe repeated calls.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/git-service.ts` (ensureRepositoriesDirectory method, idempotency)

## Current State

- GitService.ensureRepositoriesDirectory() exists
- Idempotency handling exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/git-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for idempotency may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies idempotent behavior.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review GitService.ensureRepositoriesDirectory() implementation
- [ ] Review idempotency logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/git-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use test filesystem mocking

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'ensureRepositoriesDirectory() is idempotent'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other GitService tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Mock `fs.existsSync` to return true (directory exists)
  - [ ] Mock `fs.mkdirSync` to track calls
- [ ] Step 3: Test ensureRepositoriesDirectory() idempotency
  - [ ] Call `ensureRepositoriesDirectory()` first time
  - [ ] Verify no error is thrown
  - [ ] Call `ensureRepositoriesDirectory()` second time
  - [ ] Verify no error is thrown
  - [ ] Verify mkdirSync is not called when directory exists (or called safely)
- [ ] Step 4: Verify idempotency
  - [ ] Assert multiple calls don't cause errors
  - [ ] Assert behavior is consistent

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Multiple calls are safe
  - Acceptance: No errors on repeated calls
  - Acceptance: Behavior is consistent
- [ ] Requirement 2: Idempotency is correct
  - Acceptance: Repeated calls have same effect as single call
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Directory exists but is a file (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/git-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining idempotency

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify idempotency works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 14: Filesystem & Workspace Services
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-14.1.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-14.1.3
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Idempotency prevents errors on repeated calls
  - Should check if directory exists before creating
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-14.1.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-14.1.3
- Next: TASK-14.2.1
- Dependencies: TASK-14.1.3

  - TASK-14.1: GitService (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/git-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Idempotency is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want idempotent operations so repeated calls are safe
- As a **system**, I want idempotency so initialization is safe

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies idempotent behavior
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-2.6.4: Test shutdown() handles errors gracefully

**Section**: 2. Core Application Lifecycle
**Subsection**: 2.6.4
**Task ID**: TASK-2.6.4
**Parent Task**: TASK-2.6

## Description

Write a test to verify that `shutdown()` handles errors gracefully (logs but doesn't throw) when `server.stop()` throws an error. This ensures shutdown completes even if some cleanup steps fail.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/index.ts` (shutdown method, error handling)

## Current State

- `shutdown()` method exists
- `Server.stop()` method exists
- `tests/index.test.ts` exists
- Test for shutdown error handling may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies graceful error handling during shutdown.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `shutdown()` implementation
- [ ] Review error handling logic in shutdown
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper from Phase 1.1

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'shutdown() handles errors gracefully'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other shutdown tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Create CursorRunner instance with mocked server
  - [ ] Mock `server.stop()` to throw an error
  - [ ] Set up logger spy to capture log messages
- [ ] Step 3: Test shutdown with error
  - [ ] Call `shutdown()` method
  - [ ] Verify shutdown completes successfully (doesn't throw)
  - [ ] Verify error is logged
  - [ ] Verify log message indicates the error
- [ ] Step 4: Verify graceful handling
  - [ ] Assert shutdown() doesn't throw
  - [ ] Assert error is logged
  - [ ] Assert shutdown completes

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Errors don't prevent shutdown
  - Acceptance: shutdown() completes successfully even when server.stop() throws
  - Acceptance: No exception is propagated from shutdown()
- [ ] Requirement 2: Errors are logged
  - Acceptance: Error is logged when server.stop() throws
  - Acceptance: Log message indicates the error
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Mocks are properly cleaned up

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Multiple errors during shutdown
  - Verify all errors are logged (if applicable)
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: Different error types
  - Verify various error types are handled correctly

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:unit`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify shutdown completes despite error
- [ ] Verify error is logged
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining graceful error handling
- [ ] Document why errors don't prevent shutdown

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify graceful error handling works
- [ ] Verify error is logged appropriately
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: Core Application Lifecycle
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-2.6.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-2.6.3, TASK-1.1.4 (createMockServer helper)
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Shutdown should complete even if cleanup fails
  - Errors should be logged but not prevent shutdown
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-2.6.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-2.6.3
- Next: TASK-2.7.1 (if exists) or TASK-3.1.1
- Dependencies: TASK-2.6.3, TASK-1.1.4
- Related:
  - TASK-2.6: CursorRunner.shutdown() (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/index.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Graceful error handling is verified
4. Error logging is verified
5. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
6. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
7. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want shutdown to complete even if cleanup fails so the process can exit
- As a **system**, I want errors logged during shutdown so I can diagnose cleanup issues

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies shutdown completes when server.stop() throws
- Test verifies error is logged
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-5.1.1: Test GET /api/list returns conversations from conversationService

**Section**: 5. HTTP Server - Conversation API
**Subsection**: 5.1.1
**Task ID**: TASK-5.1.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-5.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `GET /api/list` returns conversations from `conversationService.listConversations()`. This ensures the conversation listing endpoint works correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (GET /api/list endpoint), `src/conversation-service.ts` (listConversations method)

## Current State

- GET /api/list endpoint exists
- ConversationService.listConversations() exists
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for conversation listing may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies conversation listing functionality.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review GET /api/list endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review ConversationService.listConversations() method
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` and `createMockRedisClient()` helpers

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'GET /api/list returns conversations from conversationService'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for /api/list endpoint tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `conversationService.listConversations()` to return test conversations array
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test list endpoint
  - [ ] Make GET request to `/api/list`
  - [ ] Verify response status is 200
  - [ ] Verify response body contains conversations array
  - [ ] Verify conversations match mocked return value
- [ ] Step 4: Verify response structure
  - [ ] Use `assertSuccessResponse()` helper
  - [ ] Verify response is an array
  - [ ] Verify conversation objects have expected structure

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Conversations are returned
  - Acceptance: Response contains conversations from listConversations()
  - Acceptance: Conversations array is present
- [ ] Requirement 2: Response status is 200
  - Acceptance: HTTP status code is 200
  - Acceptance: Response is successful
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Mocks are properly cleaned up

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify conversations are returned correctly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining what is being tested
- [ ] Document expected response format

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify response matches expected contract
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 5: HTTP Server - Conversation API
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-4.5.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-4.5.3, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Use test helpers from Phase 1.1
  - Mock conversationService to return predictable data
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-4.5.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-4.5.3
- Next: TASK-5.1.2
- Dependencies: TASK-4.5.3, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Conversation listing is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want to list conversations so I can see all available conversations
- As a **client**, I want conversation listing so I can browse conversation history

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies GET /api/list returns conversations
- Test verifies response structure is correct
- Test passes
- All tests pass

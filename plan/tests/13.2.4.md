# TASK-13.2.4: Test validateGmailConfig() returns missing list when vars absent

**Section**: 13. System Settings, Gmail MCP, Feature Flags
**Subsection**: 13.2.4
**Task ID**: TASK-13.2.4
**Parent Task**: TASK-13.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `validateGmailConfig()` returns a list of missing variables when required environment variables are absent. This ensures validation identifies what's missing.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/system-settings-gmail-validation.ts` (validateGmailConfig method, missing vars detection)

## Current State

- validateGmailConfig() exists
- Missing variable detection exists
- `tests/system-settings-gmail-validation.test.ts` exists
- Test for missing variables may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies missing variable detection.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review validateGmailConfig() implementation
- [ ] Review required environment variables list
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/system-settings-gmail-validation.test.ts`
- [ ] Use test environment setup

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'validateGmailConfig() returns missing list when vars absent'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other Gmail MCP tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test environment
  - [ ] Use `beforeEach` to save original env vars
  - [ ] Delete all required Gmail MCP environment variables
  - [ ] Use `afterEach` to restore original env vars
- [ ] Step 3: Test validateGmailConfig() with missing vars
  - [ ] Call `validateGmailConfig()`
  - [ ] Verify validation result indicates invalid
  - [ ] Verify missing variables list includes all required vars
  - [ ] Verify list is complete and accurate
- [ ] Step 4: Verify missing variable detection
  - [ ] Assert validation is invalid
  - [ ] Assert missing list includes all required vars
  - [ ] Assert list is accurate

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Missing vars are detected
  - Acceptance: Returns list of missing variables
  - Acceptance: List includes all missing vars
- [ ] Requirement 2: Detection is accurate
  - Acceptance: Only missing vars are in list
  - Acceptance: List is complete
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Some vars present, some missing (verify partial list)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/system-settings-gmail-validation.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining missing variable detection

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify missing variable detection works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 13: System Settings, Gmail MCP, Feature Flags
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-13.2.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-13.2.3
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Missing list should be complete
  - List should help users fix configuration
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-13.2.3

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/system-settings-gmail-validation.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Missing variable detection is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want missing variable lists so I know what to configure
- As a **client**, I want clear feedback so I can fix configuration issues

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies missing list is returned when vars absent
- Test passes
- All tests pass

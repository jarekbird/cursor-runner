# TASK-10.1.2: Test CursorCLI logs "waiting" when all slots busy

**Section**: 10. CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
**Subsection**: 10.1.2
**Task ID**: TASK-10.1.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-10.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorCLI.executeCommand()` logs "waiting" when all semaphore slots are busy and additional commands must wait. This ensures visibility into queue behavior.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-cli.ts` (executeCommand method, waiting log)

## Current State

- CursorCLI.executeCommand() exists
- Waiting log exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts` exists
- Test for waiting log may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies waiting log behavior.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorCLI.executeCommand() implementation
- [ ] Review logging implementation
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'executeCommand() logs "waiting" when all slots busy'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other semaphore tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test environment
  - [ ] Set `CURSOR_CLI_MAX_CONCURRENT` to a test value (e.g., 2)
  - [ ] Use `beforeEach` to save original value
  - [ ] Use `afterEach` to restore original value
- [ ] Step 3: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `child_process.spawn` to simulate long-running commands
  - [ ] Set up logger spy to capture log messages
- [ ] Step 4: Test waiting log
  - [ ] Start MAX_CONCURRENT commands to fill all slots
  - [ ] Start additional command (should wait)
  - [ ] Verify "waiting" log message is emitted
  - [ ] Verify log message is clear and informative
- [ ] Step 5: Verify logging
  - [ ] Assert logger is called with "waiting" message
  - [ ] Assert log message indicates queue is full

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Waiting is logged
  - Acceptance: Logger is called with "waiting" message when slots are full
  - Acceptance: Log message is clear
- [ ] Requirement 2: Log timing is correct
  - Acceptance: Log is emitted when command must wait
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Multiple waiting commands (verify all log waiting)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining waiting log

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify waiting log works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 10: CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-10.1.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-10.1.1, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Waiting log provides visibility into queue behavior
  - Log should be informative
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-10.1.1

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-10.1.1
- Next: TASK-10.1.3
- Dependencies: TASK-10.1.1, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-10.1: CursorCLI - Semaphore & Queue Status (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Waiting log is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want waiting logs so I can see when commands are queued
- As an **operator**, I want visibility into queue behavior so I can monitor system load

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies "waiting" log is emitted when slots are busy
- Test passes
- All tests pass

### Step 2.6: CursorRunner.shutdown()
**Objective**: Test graceful shutdown behavior.

This task has been broken down into granular subtasks:

1. [TASK-2.6.1](./2.6.1.md): Test shutdown() calls server.stop()
2. [TASK-2.6.2](./2.6.2.md): Test shutdown() logs memory usage
3. [TASK-2.6.3](./2.6.3.md): Test shutdown() logs call stack information
4. [TASK-2.6.4](./2.6.4.md): Test shutdown() handles errors gracefully

**Note**: Complete all subtasks in order (2.6.1 → 2.6.2 → 2.6.3 → 2.6.4). Each subtask is independently completable with its own Definition of Done.

**Original Tasks**:
1. Extend `tests/index.test.ts`:
   - Add test: `shutdown()` calls `server.stop()`
   - Add test: `shutdown()` logs memory usage
   - Add test: `shutdown()` logs call stack information
   - Add test: `shutdown()` handles errors gracefully (logs but doesn't throw)

**Tests**:
- Mock `server.stop()` and verify it's called
- Capture logger calls to verify memory usage and stack are logged
- Mock `server.stop()` to throw and verify error is logged

**Verification**:
- Tests pass and confirm shutdown is graceful
- Logs contain useful diagnostic information
- Errors don't prevent shutdown completion

# TASK-9.3.4: Test CursorExecutionService.execute() returns SuccessResponse with correct structure

**Section**: 9. Execution Orchestration
**Subsection**: 9.3.4
**Task ID**: TASK-9.3.4
**Parent Task**: TASK-9.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorExecutionService.execute()` returns `SuccessResponse` with the correct structure when execution succeeds. This ensures success responses are properly formatted.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (execute method, SuccessResponse structure)

## Current State

- CursorExecutionService.execute() exists
- SuccessResponse structure exists
- `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for SuccessResponse structure may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies success response structure.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorExecutionService.execute() implementation
- [ ] Review SuccessResponse structure definition
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` and `createMockCursorCLI()` helpers

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'execute() returns SuccessResponse with correct structure'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other execution flow tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `CursorCLI.executeCommand()` to return success result
- [ ] Step 3: Test execute() success case
  - [ ] Call `execute()` with test request
  - [ ] Verify SuccessResponse is returned
  - [ ] Verify response structure matches expected format
  - [ ] Verify response includes all required fields
- [ ] Step 4: Verify response structure
  - [ ] Assert response has status field
  - [ ] Assert response has body field
  - [ ] Assert response structure matches SuccessResponse type

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: SuccessResponse is returned
  - Acceptance: Response is SuccessResponse type
  - Acceptance: Response indicates success
- [ ] Requirement 2: Response structure is correct
  - Acceptance: Response includes all required fields
  - Acceptance: Field types are correct
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Success with empty output (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining SuccessResponse structure

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify response structure is correct
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 9: Execution Orchestration
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-9.3.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-9.3.3, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - SuccessResponse should have consistent structure
  - Response should include all execution results
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-9.3.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-9.3.3
- Next: TASK-9.3.5
- Dependencies: TASK-9.3.3, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6

  - TASK-9.3: CursorExecutionService - Execution Flows (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. SuccessResponse structure is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want consistent response structure so I can process results reliably
- As a **client**, I want success responses so I know execution succeeded

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies SuccessResponse structure is correct
- Test passes
- All tests pass

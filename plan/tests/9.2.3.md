# TASK-9.2.3: Test Review agent prompts do not include system instructions

**Section**: 9. Execution Orchestration
**Subsection**: 9.2.3
**Task ID**: TASK-9.2.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-9.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that review agent prompts do not include system instructions. This ensures review agent prompts remain clean without MCP instructions.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (execute method, review agent prompt handling)

## Current State

- CursorExecutionService.execute() exists
- Review agent detection exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for review agent exclusion may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies review agent prompts exclude system instructions.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorExecutionService.execute() implementation
- [ ] Review how review agent prompts are identified
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'Review agent prompts do not include system instructions'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other system instructions tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `CommandParserService` to track prompt construction
  - [ ] Mock system settings to return test MCP instructions
- [ ] Step 3: Test execute() with review agent prompt
  - [ ] Call `execute()` with review agent prompt (identify how review agent is detected)
  - [ ] Verify CommandParserService was called with prompt
  - [ ] Verify prompt does NOT include SYSTEM_SETTINGS_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS
- [ ] Step 4: Verify exclusion
  - [ ] Assert prompt does not contain system instructions
  - [ ] Assert review agent prompt is unchanged

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: System instructions are excluded
  - Acceptance: Review agent prompts do not include SYSTEM_SETTINGS_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS
  - Acceptance: Instructions are not appended
- [ ] Requirement 2: Review agent prompt is correct
  - Acceptance: Prompt is unchanged (no instructions added)
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Review agent prompt with existing instructions (verify not added)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining review agent exclusion

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify review agent prompts exclude system instructions
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 9: Execution Orchestration
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-9.2.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-9.2.2, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Review agent prompts should not include system instructions
  - Review agent has its own context
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-9.2.2

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-9.2.2
- Next: TASK-9.3.1
- Dependencies: TASK-9.2.2, TASK-1.1.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Review agent exclusion is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want review agent prompts clean so they don't include MCP instructions
- As a **system**, I want proper prompt separation so review agent works correctly

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies review agent prompts do not include system instructions
- Test passes
- All tests pass

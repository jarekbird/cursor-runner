# TASK-6.2.1: Test POST /api/agent/new creates conversation with optional agentId

**Section**: 6. HTTP Server - Agent Conversation API
**Subsection**: 6.2.1
**Task ID**: TASK-6.2.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-6.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `POST /api/agent/new` creates a conversation with an optional `agentId` parameter. This ensures agent conversations can be associated with specific agents.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /api/agent/new endpoint), `src/agent-conversation-service.ts` (createConversation method)

## Current State

- POST /api/agent/new endpoint exists
- AgentConversationService.createConversation() exists
- `tests/agent-conversation-api.integration.test.ts` exists
- Test for agentId handling may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies agent conversation creation with optional agentId.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /api/agent/new endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review AgentConversationService.createConversation() method
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/agent-conversation-api.integration.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'POST /api/agent/new creates conversation with optional agentId'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for /api/agent/new endpoint tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `agentConversationService.createConversation()` to return test conversation ID
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test endpoint with agentId
  - [ ] Test case 1: Make POST request to `/api/agent/new` with body: `{ agentId: 'test-agent-id' }`
  - [ ] Verify createConversation() was called with agentId: 'test-agent-id'
  - [ ] Verify response is successful
  - [ ] Test case 2: Make POST request to `/api/agent/new` with body: `{}` (no agentId)
  - [ ] Verify createConversation() was called without agentId (or with null/undefined)
  - [ ] Verify response is successful
- [ ] Step 4: Verify agentId handling
  - [ ] Assert agentId is passed to createConversation() when provided
  - [ ] Assert agentId is optional (conversation created without it)

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: agentId is optional
  - Acceptance: Conversation can be created with or without agentId
  - Acceptance: agentId is passed to createConversation() when provided
- [ ] Requirement 2: Conversation is created
  - Acceptance: createConversation() is called
  - Acceptance: Conversation ID is returned
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: agentId is empty string (verify if treated as missing or invalid)
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: agentId is null (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/agent-conversation-api.integration.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining agentId handling
- [ ] Document agentId as optional parameter

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify agentId handling is correct
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 6: HTTP Server - Agent Conversation API
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-6.1.6
- **Dependencies**: TASK-6.1.6, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - agentId should be optional
  - agentId should be passed through to service when provided
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-6.1.6

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-6.1.6
- Next: TASK-6.2.2
- Dependencies: TASK-6.1.6, TASK-1.1.4
- Related:
  - TASK-6.2: POST /api/agent/new (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/agent-conversation-api.integration.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. agentId handling is verified (with and without agentId)
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want optional agentId so conversations can be associated with agents
- As a **client**, I want to specify agentId so I can track which agent handles conversations

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies conversation created with agentId
- Test verifies conversation created without agentId
- Test passes
- All tests pass

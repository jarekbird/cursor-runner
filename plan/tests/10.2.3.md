# TASK-10.2.3: Test CursorCLI safety timeout releases semaphore even if exit events don't fire

**Section**: 10. CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
**Subsection**: 10.2.3
**Task ID**: TASK-10.2.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-10.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorCLI.executeCommand()` releases the semaphore even if exit events don't fire, using the safety timeout as a fallback. This ensures semaphore cleanup happens reliably.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-cli.ts` (executeCommand method, safety timeout, semaphore cleanup)

## Current State

- CursorCLI.executeCommand() exists
- Safety timeout handling exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts` exists
- Test for safety timeout semaphore cleanup may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies semaphore cleanup reliability.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorCLI.executeCommand() implementation
- [ ] Review safety timeout configuration
- [ ] Review semaphore cleanup logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'safety timeout releases semaphore even if exit events don't fire'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other timeout tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test environment
  - [ ] Set safety timeout to a short test value (e.g., 200ms)
  - [ ] Use `beforeEach` to save original value
  - [ ] Use `afterEach` to restore original value
- [ ] Step 3: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `child_process.spawn` to simulate command that doesn't emit exit events
  - [ ] Track semaphore state
- [ ] Step 4: Test safety timeout semaphore cleanup
  - [ ] Call `executeCommand()` with test command
  - [ ] Verify exit events don't fire (or are prevented)
  - [ ] Wait for safety timeout to trigger
  - [ ] Verify semaphore is released
  - [ ] Verify semaphore slot becomes available
- [ ] Step 5: Verify semaphore cleanup
  - [ ] Assert semaphore is released after safety timeout
  - [ ] Assert semaphore slot is available for new commands
  - [ ] Assert no semaphore leaks occur

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Semaphore is released
  - Acceptance: Semaphore is released when safety timeout triggers
  - Acceptance: Semaphore slot becomes available
- [ ] Requirement 2: Cleanup is reliable
  - Acceptance: Cleanup happens even without exit events
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: No semaphore leaks

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Exit event fires after safety timeout (verify no double release)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify semaphore cleanup works correctly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining safety timeout semaphore cleanup

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify semaphore cleanup works correctly
- [ ] Verify no semaphore leaks
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 10: CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-10.2.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-10.2.2, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Safety timeout is a fallback for semaphore cleanup
  - Prevents semaphore leaks
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-10.2.2

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-10.2.2
- Next: TASK-10.3.1
- Dependencies: TASK-10.2.2, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-10.2: CursorCLI - Timeout Handling (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Semaphore cleanup is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want semaphore cleanup so resources aren't leaked
- As a **system**, I want reliable cleanup so semaphore slots are always available

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies safety timeout releases semaphore
- Test passes
- All tests pass

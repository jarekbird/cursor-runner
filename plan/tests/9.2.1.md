# TASK-9.2.1: Test CursorExecutionService.execute() appends SYSTEM_SETTINGS_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS to non-review prompts

**Section**: 9. Execution Orchestration
**Subsection**: 9.2.1
**Task ID**: TASK-9.2.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-9.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorExecutionService.execute()` appends `SYSTEM_SETTINGS_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS` to non-review prompts. This ensures system instructions are included in execution prompts.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (execute method, system instructions appending), `src/command-parser-service.ts` (prompt construction)

## Current State

- CursorExecutionService.execute() exists
- System instructions appending exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for system instructions appending may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies system instructions are appended correctly.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorExecutionService.execute() implementation
- [ ] Review CommandParserService prompt construction
- [ ] Review how SYSTEM_SETTINGS_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS is retrieved
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'execute() appends SYSTEM_SETTINGS_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS to non-review prompts'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for CursorExecutionService system instructions tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `CommandParserService` to track prompt construction
  - [ ] Mock system settings to return test MCP instructions
- [ ] Step 3: Test execute() with non-review prompt
  - [ ] Call `execute()` with non-review prompt (not from review agent)
  - [ ] Verify CommandParserService was called with prompt that includes system instructions
  - [ ] Verify system instructions are appended to the prompt
- [ ] Step 4: Verify instruction appending
  - [ ] Assert prompt includes SYSTEM_SETTINGS_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS
  - [ ] Assert instructions are appended correctly

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: System instructions are appended
  - Acceptance: Prompt includes SYSTEM_SETTINGS_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS
  - Acceptance: Instructions are appended to non-review prompts
- [ ] Requirement 2: Instructions are correct
  - Acceptance: Instructions match system settings value
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: SYSTEM_SETTINGS_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS is empty (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining system instructions appending

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify system instructions are appended correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 9: Execution Orchestration
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-9.1.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-9.1.3, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - System instructions should only be appended to non-review prompts
  - Instructions should come from system settings
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-9.1.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-9.1.3
- Next: TASK-9.2.2
- Dependencies: TASK-9.1.3, TASK-1.1.4
- Related:
  - TASK-9.2: CursorExecutionService - System Instructions (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. System instructions appending is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want system instructions appended so MCP context is included
- As a **system**, I want system instructions so execution has proper context

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies system instructions are appended to non-review prompts
- Test passes
- All tests pass

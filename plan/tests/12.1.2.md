# TASK-12.1.2: Test TaskService.listTasks(status) filters by status

**Section**: 12. Persistence & Migrations
**Subsection**: 12.1.2
**Task ID**: TASK-12.1.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-12.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `TaskService.listTasks(status)` filters tasks by status when status parameter is provided. This ensures status filtering works correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/task-service.ts` (listTasks method, status filtering)

## Current State

- TaskService.listTasks() exists
- Status filtering exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/task-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for status filtering may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies status filtering.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review TaskService.listTasks() implementation
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/task-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createTempSqliteDb()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'listTasks(status) filters by status'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other basic operations tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test database
  - [ ] Use `createTempSqliteDb()` helper in `beforeAll`
  - [ ] Run migrations to set up schema
- [ ] Step 3: Set up test data
  - [ ] Create test tasks with status 0 (ready)
  - [ ] Create test tasks with status 1 (complete)
- [ ] Step 4: Test status filtering
  - [ ] Test case 1: Call `listTasks(0)` - verify only status 0 tasks returned
  - [ ] Test case 2: Call `listTasks(1)` - verify only status 1 tasks returned
- [ ] Step 5: Verify filtering
  - [ ] Assert only tasks with specified status are returned
  - [ ] Assert tasks with other statuses are excluded

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Filtering works
  - Acceptance: Only tasks with specified status are returned
  - Acceptance: Tasks with other statuses are excluded
- [ ] Requirement 2: Filtering is correct
  - Acceptance: Status filter is applied correctly
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/task-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining status filtering

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify status filtering works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 12: Persistence & Migrations
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-12.1.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-12.1.1, TASK-1.1.2, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Status filtering should work correctly
  - Use real SQLite database for integration test
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-12.1.1

## Related Tasks

  - TASK-12.1: TaskService - Basic Operations (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/task-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Status filtering is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want status filtering so I can get tasks by status
- As a **client**, I want filtered tasks so I can process ready tasks separately

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies status filtering works correctly
- Test passes
- All tests pass

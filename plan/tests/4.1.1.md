# TASK-4.1.1: Test POST /cursor/execute happy path

**Section**: 4. HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
**Subsection**: 4.1.1
**Task ID**: TASK-4.1.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-4.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `POST /cursor/execute` happy path returns the result from `cursorExecution.execute()`. This ensures the synchronous cursor execution endpoint works correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /cursor/execute endpoint), `src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (execute method)

## Current State

- POST /cursor/execute endpoint exists
- `cursorExecution.execute()` exists
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for execute endpoint may not exist yet

**Important**: This is the first cursor execution endpoint test and establishes the pattern.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /cursor/execute endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review `cursorExecution.execute()` method signature
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper from Phase 1.1

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'POST /cursor/execute happy path'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for cursor/execute endpoint tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `cursorExecution.execute()` to return success: `{ status: 200, body: { result: 'success' } }`
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test execute endpoint
  - [ ] Make POST request to `/cursor/execute` with test body: `{ prompt: 'test prompt' }`
  - [ ] Verify response status is 200
  - [ ] Verify response body matches execute() return value
  - [ ] Verify execute() was called with correct parameters
- [ ] Step 4: Verify response structure
  - [ ] Use `assertSuccessResponse()` helper
  - [ ] Verify response matches execute() return structure
  - [ ] Verify all expected fields are present

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Response matches execute() result
  - Acceptance: Response body matches execute() return value
  - Acceptance: Response status matches execute() status
- [ ] Requirement 2: execute() is called correctly
  - Acceptance: execute() is called with request body parameters
  - Acceptance: execute() is called once
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Mocks are properly cleaned up

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Missing required body fields
  - Verify validation (may be separate test)
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: Empty prompt
  - Verify validation (may be separate test)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify execute() is called correctly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining what is being tested
- [ ] Document expected request/response format

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify response matches expected contract
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 4: HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after Phase 3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Use test helpers from Phase 1.1
  - Mock cursorExecution.execute() to return predictable values
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after Phase 1.1

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-3.2.3
- Next: TASK-4.1.2
- Dependencies: TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6

  - TASK-4.1: POST /cursor/execute (Synchronous) (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. execute() call and response are verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want to execute cursor commands synchronously so I can get immediate results
- As a **client**, I want synchronous execution so I can wait for results before proceeding

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies POST /cursor/execute returns execute() result
- Test verifies execute() is called correctly
- Test passes
- All tests pass

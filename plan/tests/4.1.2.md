# TASK-4.1.2: Test POST /cursor/execute with queueType in body

**Section**: 4. HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
**Subsection**: 4.1.2
**Task ID**: TASK-4.1.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-4.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `POST /cursor/execute` uses the provided `queueType` value from the request body. This ensures queue type can be explicitly specified.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /cursor/execute endpoint, queueType handling)

## Current State

- POST /cursor/execute endpoint exists
- queueType handling exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for queueType handling may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies explicit queueType parameter handling.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /cursor/execute endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review how queueType is extracted from request body
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'POST /cursor/execute with queueType in body uses provided value'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other cursor/execute tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `cursorExecution.execute()` to track queueType parameter
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test execute endpoint with queueType
  - [ ] Make POST request to `/cursor/execute` with body: `{ prompt: 'test', queueType: 'api' }`
  - [ ] Verify execute() was called with queueType: 'api'
  - [ ] Verify response is successful
- [ ] Step 4: Verify queueType is used
  - [ ] Assert execute() receives correct queueType value
  - [ ] Assert queueType is passed through correctly

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: queueType from body is used
  - Acceptance: execute() is called with queueType from request body
  - Acceptance: queueType value matches request body value
- [ ] Requirement 2: queueType is passed correctly
  - Acceptance: queueType parameter is extracted from body
  - Acceptance: queueType is passed to execute() method
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Mocks are properly cleaned up

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: queueType is missing from body
  - Verify default queueType is used (may be separate test)
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: Invalid queueType value
  - Verify validation (may be separate test)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify queueType is used correctly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining queueType handling
- [ ] Document valid queueType values

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify queueType handling is correct
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 4: HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-4.1.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-4.1.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - queueType determines which conversation queue to use
  - Should support explicit queueType specification
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-4.1.1

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-4.1.1
- Next: TASK-4.1.3
- Dependencies: TASK-4.1.1, TASK-1.1.4
- Related:
  - TASK-4.1: POST /cursor/execute (Synchronous) (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. queueType handling is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want to specify queueType so I can control which conversation queue is used
- As a **client**, I want to set queueType so I can organize executions by source

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies queueType from body is used
- Test verifies queueType is passed to execute()
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-2.2.8: Test initialize() logs startup messages

**Section**: 2. Core Application Lifecycle
**Subsection**: 2.2.8
**Task ID**: TASK-2.2.8
**Parent Task**: TASK-2.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `initialize()` logs appropriate startup messages during initialization. This ensures logging provides visibility into the startup process.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/index.ts` (initialize method, logger usage)

## Current State

- `initialize()` method exists
- Logger is used throughout the codebase
- `tests/index.test.ts` exists
- Test for startup logging may not exist yet

**Important**: This verifies logging provides visibility into startup.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `initialize()` implementation
- [ ] Review logger usage patterns
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Understand how to capture/mock logger calls

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'initialize() logs startup messages'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other initialize() tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up logger spy
  - [ ] Create CursorRunner instance
  - [ ] Use `jest.spyOn` to spy on logger methods (info, warn, etc.)
  - [ ] Mock all dependencies
- [ ] Step 3: Test initialization
  - [ ] Call `initialize()` method
  - [ ] Verify logger was called with startup messages
  - [ ] Verify log messages contain expected information
- [ ] Step 4: Verify log content
  - [ ] Assert logs contain startup information
  - [ ] Assert log levels are appropriate (info for success, warn for issues)
  - [ ] Assert logs are helpful for debugging

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Startup messages are logged
  - Acceptance: Logger is called during initialize
  - Acceptance: Log messages contain startup information
- [ ] Requirement 2: Log messages are informative
  - Acceptance: Messages help identify startup progress
  - Acceptance: Messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Logger spy is properly cleaned up

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Logger is not available
  - Verify initialize handles missing logger gracefully (if applicable)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:unit`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining what is being tested
- [ ] Document expected log message patterns

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify startup messages are logged
- [ ] Verify log messages are informative
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: Core Application Lifecycle
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-2.2.7
- **Dependencies**: TASK-2.2.7
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Logging should provide visibility without being too verbose
  - Focus on verifying key startup messages
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-2.2.7

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/index.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Startup log messages are verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want to see startup logs so I can debug initialization issues
- As an **operator**, I want startup logs so I can verify the system started correctly

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies startup messages are logged
- Test verifies log content is informative
- Test passes
- All tests pass

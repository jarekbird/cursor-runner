# TASK-9.2.2: Test CursorExecutionService.execute() does not duplicate system instructions across iterations

**Section**: 9. Execution Orchestration
**Subsection**: 9.2.2
**Task ID**: TASK-9.2.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-9.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorExecutionService.execute()` does not duplicate system instructions across iterations. This ensures system instructions are only added once per conversation.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (execute method, system instructions deduplication)

## Current State

- CursorExecutionService.execute() exists
- System instructions deduplication exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for instruction deduplication may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies system instructions are not duplicated.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorExecutionService.execute() implementation
- [ ] Review how system instructions are tracked across iterations
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'execute() does not duplicate system instructions across iterations'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other system instructions tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `CommandParserService` to track prompt construction
  - [ ] Mock system settings to return test MCP instructions
- [ ] Step 3: Test execute() across multiple iterations
  - [ ] Call `execute()` first time with non-review prompt
  - [ ] Verify system instructions are included
  - [ ] Call `execute()` second time in same conversation
  - [ ] Verify system instructions are not duplicated (only appear once)
- [ ] Step 4: Verify deduplication
  - [ ] Assert system instructions appear only once in final prompt
  - [ ] Assert instructions are not appended multiple times

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Instructions are not duplicated
  - Acceptance: System instructions appear only once per conversation
  - Acceptance: Multiple iterations don't add duplicate instructions
- [ ] Requirement 2: Instructions are still present
  - Acceptance: Instructions are included (not removed)
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Instructions already in prompt (verify not duplicated)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining deduplication behavior

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify deduplication works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 9: Execution Orchestration
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-9.2.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-9.2.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - System instructions should only be added once
  - Deduplication prevents prompt bloat
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-9.2.1

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-9.2.1
- Next: TASK-9.2.3
- Dependencies: TASK-9.2.1, TASK-1.1.4
- Related:
  - TASK-9.2: CursorExecutionService - System Instructions (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Deduplication is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want no duplication so prompts don't get bloated
- As a **system**, I want efficient prompts so execution is faster

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies system instructions are not duplicated across iterations
- Test passes
- All tests pass

### Step 9.4: CursorExecutionService - Callback Webhook
**Objective**: Test callback webhook behavior.

This task has been broken down into granular subtasks:

1. [TASK-9.4.1](./9.4.1.md): Test callbackWebhook() sends success payload with all required fields
2. [TASK-9.4.2](./9.4.2.md): Test callbackWebhook() sends error payload with partial output when command fails
3. [TASK-9.4.3](./9.4.3.md): Test callbackWebhook() logs HTTP errors but doesn't throw

**Note**: Complete all subtasks in order (9.4.1 → 9.4.2 → 9.4.3). Each subtask is independently completable with its own Definition of Done.

**Original Tasks**:
1. Extend `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`:
   - Add test: `callbackWebhook()` sends success payload with all required fields
   - Add test: `callbackWebhook()` sends error payload with partial output when command fails
   - Add test: `callbackWebhook()` logs HTTP errors but doesn't throw
   - Mock HTTP client (e.g., `fetch` or `axios`) to simulate callback target

**Tests**:
- Verify payload structure
- Verify error handling
- Verify logging

**Verification**:
- Tests pass
- Callbacks are reliable

# TASK-8.2.3: Test POST /telegram/webhook handles callback_query update type

**Section**: 8. HTTP Server - Repository & Telegram Routes
**Subsection**: 8.2.3
**Task ID**: TASK-8.2.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-8.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `POST /telegram/webhook` handles `callback_query` update type correctly. This ensures Telegram callback query updates (button clicks) are processed properly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /telegram/webhook endpoint, callback_query handling)

## Current State

- POST /telegram/webhook endpoint exists
- Callback query update handling exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for callback_query update type may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies callback_query update type handling.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /telegram/webhook endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review how callback_query updates are processed
- [ ] Review Telegram webhook update structure
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'POST /telegram/webhook handles callback_query update type'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other /telegram/webhook tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock Telegram webhook handler or callback query processing logic
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test endpoint with callback_query update
  - [ ] Create Telegram webhook payload with `callback_query` update type
  - [ ] Make POST request to `/telegram/webhook` with payload
  - [ ] Verify response status is 200
  - [ ] Verify callback query handler was called
  - [ ] Verify callback query was processed correctly
- [ ] Step 4: Verify callback query handling
  - [ ] Assert callback query handler receives correct data
  - [ ] Assert response indicates success

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Callback query update is handled
  - Acceptance: Callback query handler is called with correct data
  - Acceptance: Callback query is processed correctly
- [ ] Requirement 2: Response status is 200
  - Acceptance: HTTP status code is 200
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Callback query without data (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining callback_query update handling

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify callback_query handling works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 8: HTTP Server - Repository & Telegram Routes
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-8.2.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-8.2.2, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.6
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Callback queries are for inline button clicks
  - Should trigger appropriate action based on callback data
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-8.2.2

## Related Tasks

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Callback query update handling is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want callback_query updates handled so button clicks are processed
- As a **system**, I want callback query handling so users can interact with buttons

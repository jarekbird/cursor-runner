# TASK-2.5.2: Test verifyMcpConfig() logs info when mcp.json exists

**Section**: 2. Core Application Lifecycle
**Subsection**: 2.5.2
**Task ID**: TASK-2.5.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-2.5

## Description

Write a test to verify that `verifyMcpConfig()` logs an info message when `/root/.cursor/mcp.json` exists. This ensures developers are informed when MCP configuration is properly set up.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/index.ts` (verifyMcpConfig method)

## Current State

- `verifyMcpConfig()` method exists
- `tests/index.test.ts` exists
- Test for MCP config existing case may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies logging behavior when MCP config exists.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `verifyMcpConfig()` implementation
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Understand logger usage patterns

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'verifyMcpConfig() logs info when mcp.json exists'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other MCP config tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Create CursorRunner instance
  - [ ] Mock `fs.existsSync` to return true for `/root/.cursor/mcp.json`
  - [ ] Set up logger spy to capture log messages
- [ ] Step 3: Test verification
  - [ ] Call `verifyMcpConfig()` method (or call initialize() which calls it)
  - [ ] Verify info is logged
  - [ ] Verify log message indicates mcp.json exists
- [ ] Step 4: Verify log level
  - [ ] Assert logger.info() was called (not logger.warn())
  - [ ] Assert log message is informative

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Info is logged when file exists
  - Acceptance: logger.info() is called
  - Acceptance: Info is logged at appropriate time
- [ ] Requirement 2: Log message is informative
  - Acceptance: Message indicates mcp.json exists
  - Acceptance: Message is clear
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: fs mock is properly cleaned up

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:unit`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify info is logged
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining what is being tested

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify info is logged appropriately
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: Core Application Lifecycle
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-2.5.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-2.5.1
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Info level is appropriate for successful verification
  - Log message should confirm config exists
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-2.5.1

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-2.5.1
- Next: TASK-2.5.3
- Dependencies: TASK-2.5.1

  - TASK-2.5: CursorRunner.initialize() - MCP Config Verification (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/index.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Info logging is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want to see info when MCP config exists so I know it's set up correctly
- As a **system**, I want to log MCP config status so operators know the configuration state

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies info is logged when mcp.json exists
- Test passes
- All tests pass

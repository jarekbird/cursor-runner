# TASK-14.1.3: Test GitService.ensureRepositoriesDirectory() creates directory when missing

**Section**: 14. Filesystem & Workspace Services
**Subsection**: 14.1.3
**Task ID**: TASK-14.1.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-14.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `GitService.ensureRepositoriesDirectory()` creates the repositories directory when it doesn't exist. This ensures directory creation works correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/git-service.ts` (ensureRepositoriesDirectory method)

## Current State

- GitService.ensureRepositoriesDirectory() exists
- Directory creation exists
- `tests/git-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for directory creation may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies directory creation functionality.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review GitService.ensureRepositoriesDirectory() implementation
- [ ] Review directory creation logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/git-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use test filesystem mocking

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'ensureRepositoriesDirectory() creates directory when missing'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other GitService tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Mock `fs.existsSync` to return false (directory doesn't exist)
  - [ ] Mock `fs.mkdirSync` to track calls
- [ ] Step 3: Test ensureRepositoriesDirectory() with missing directory
  - [ ] Call `ensureRepositoriesDirectory()`
  - [ ] Verify `fs.mkdirSync` was called
  - [ ] Verify directory path is correct
  - [ ] Verify directory is created with correct options (recursive, etc.)
- [ ] Step 4: Verify directory creation
  - [ ] Assert mkdirSync is called
  - [ ] Assert correct path is used

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Directory is created
  - Acceptance: mkdirSync is called when directory missing
  - Acceptance: Directory is created
- [ ] Requirement 2: Creation is correct
  - Acceptance: Correct path is used
  - Acceptance: Correct options are used
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Permission errors (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/git-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining directory creation

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify directory creation works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 14: Filesystem & Workspace Services
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-14.1.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-14.1.2
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Directory should be created recursively if needed
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-14.1.2

## Related Tasks

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/git-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Directory creation is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want directory creation so repositories directory exists automatically
- As a **system**, I want automatic directory creation so setup is simpler

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies directory is created when missing
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-4.2.4: Test POST /cursor/execute/async sends callback on success

**Section**: 4. HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
**Subsection**: 4.2.4
**Task ID**: TASK-4.2.4
**Parent Task**: TASK-4.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `POST /cursor/execute/async` sends a callback webhook to the provided `callbackUrl` when execution succeeds. This ensures success callbacks are delivered correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /cursor/execute/async endpoint, callback webhook), `src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (callbackWebhook method)

## Current State

- POST /cursor/execute/async endpoint exists
- callbackWebhook method exists
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for success callback may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies success callback delivery.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /cursor/execute/async endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review callbackWebhook() method
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
- [ ] Understand how to mock HTTP requests (fetch or axios)

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'POST /cursor/execute/async sends callback on success'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other cursor/execute/async tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `cursorExecution.execute()` to return success
  - [ ] Mock HTTP client (fetch or axios) to capture callback requests
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test async endpoint with callback
  - [ ] Make POST request to `/cursor/execute/async` with body: `{ prompt: 'test', callbackUrl: 'http://example.com/callback' }`
  - [ ] Wait for background processing to complete
  - [ ] Verify callback webhook was sent to callbackUrl
  - [ ] Verify callback payload contains execution result
- [ ] Step 4: Verify callback payload
  - [ ] Assert callback was sent to correct URL
  - [ ] Assert callback payload contains success information
  - [ ] Assert callback payload structure is correct

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Callback is sent on success
  - Acceptance: HTTP request is made to callbackUrl
  - Acceptance: Callback is sent after execution completes
- [ ] Requirement 2: Callback payload is correct
  - Acceptance: Payload contains execution result
  - Acceptance: Payload structure matches expected format
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Mocks are properly cleaned up
  - Acceptance: No actual HTTP requests are made

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Callback URL is unreachable
  - Verify error is handled gracefully (may be separate test - TASK-4.2.6)
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: Callback URL returns error
  - Verify error is handled gracefully (may be separate test - TASK-4.2.6)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify callback is sent correctly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining callback mechanism
- [ ] Document expected callback payload format

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify callback delivery works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 4: HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-4.2.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-4.2.3, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Callback should be sent after execution completes
  - Need to mock HTTP client to avoid real network requests
  - Payload should contain all relevant execution information
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-4.2.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-4.2.3
- Next: TASK-4.2.5
- Dependencies: TASK-4.2.3, TASK-1.1.4
- Related:
  - TASK-4.2: POST /cursor/execute/async (parent task)
  - TASK-4.2.6: Callback error handling

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Callback delivery is verified
4. Callback payload is verified
5. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
6. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
7. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want success callbacks so I know when execution completes
- As a **client**, I want callbacks so I can process results asynchronously

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies callback is sent on success
- Test verifies callback payload is correct
- Test passes
- All tests pass

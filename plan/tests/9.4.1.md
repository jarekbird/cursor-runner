# TASK-9.4.1: Test CursorExecutionService.callbackWebhook() sends success payload with all required fields

**Section**: 9. Execution Orchestration
**Subsection**: 9.4.1
**Task ID**: TASK-9.4.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-9.4

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorExecutionService.callbackWebhook()` sends a success payload with all required fields when execution succeeds. This ensures callback webhooks contain complete information.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (callbackWebhook method, success payload structure)

## Current State

- CursorExecutionService.callbackWebhook() exists
- Success payload structure exists
- `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for success payload may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies success callback payload structure.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorExecutionService.callbackWebhook() implementation
- [ ] Review success payload structure definition
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'callbackWebhook() sends success payload with all required fields'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for CursorExecutionService callback webhook tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock HTTP client (fetch or axios) to capture callback requests
  - [ ] Set up callback URL for testing
- [ ] Step 3: Test callbackWebhook() with success
  - [ ] Call `callbackWebhook()` with success result
  - [ ] Verify HTTP request is made to callback URL
  - [ ] Verify payload includes all required fields (status, body, iterations, etc.)
  - [ ] Verify payload structure matches expected format
- [ ] Step 4: Verify payload structure
  - [ ] Assert payload includes status field
  - [ ] Assert payload includes body field
  - [ ] Assert payload includes all execution result fields

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Success payload is sent
  - Acceptance: HTTP request is made to callback URL
  - Acceptance: Payload contains success information
- [ ] Requirement 2: Payload includes all required fields
  - Acceptance: Payload includes all expected fields
  - Acceptance: Field types are correct
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: No actual HTTP requests are made

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Success with empty body (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining success payload structure

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify payload structure is correct
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 9: Execution Orchestration
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-9.3.6
- **Dependencies**: TASK-9.3.6, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Success payload should include all execution results
  - Payload structure should be consistent
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-9.3.6

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-9.3.6
- Next: TASK-9.4.2
- Dependencies: TASK-9.3.6, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-9.4: CursorExecutionService - Callback Webhook (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Success payload structure is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want complete success payloads so I have all execution information
- As a **client**, I want success callbacks so I can process execution results

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies success payload includes all required fields
- Test passes
- All tests pass

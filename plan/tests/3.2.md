### Step 3.2: GET /health/queue Endpoint
**Objective**: Test queue status diagnostic endpoint.

This task has been broken down into granular subtasks:

1. [TASK-3.2.1](./3.2.1.md): Test GET /health/queue returns queue status
2. [TASK-3.2.2](./3.2.2.md): Test GET /health/queue includes warning when queue is full
3. [TASK-3.2.3](./3.2.3.md): Test GET /health/queue has no warning when queue is healthy

**Note**: Complete all subtasks in order (3.2.1 → 3.2.2 → 3.2.3). Each subtask is independently completable with its own Definition of Done.

**Original Tasks**:
1. Extend `tests/server.test.ts`:
   - Add test: `GET /health/queue` returns queue status from `cursorCLI.getQueueStatus()`
   - Add test: `GET /health/queue` includes `warning` field when `available === 0 && waiting > 0`
   - Add test: `GET /health/queue` has no `warning` field when queue is healthy
   - Mock `cursorCLI.getQueueStatus()` to return different states

**Tests**:
- Mock `server.cursorCLI.getQueueStatus()` to return various states
- Verify response includes queue status
- Verify warning appears only when appropriate

**Verification**:
- Tests pass
- Warning logic is correct
- Response shape matches expected contract

# TASK-13.3.5: Test shouldSendElevenLabsCallback() returns false and logs when feature disabled

**Section**: 13. System Settings, Gmail MCP, Feature Flags
**Subsection**: 13.3.5
**Task ID**: TASK-13.3.5
**Parent Task**: TASK-13.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `shouldSendElevenLabsCallback()` returns false and logs when the ElevenLabs feature is disabled. This ensures callback suppression works when feature is off.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/feature-flags.ts` (shouldSendElevenLabsCallback method, feature disabled handling)

## Current State

- shouldSendElevenLabsCallback() exists
- Feature disabled handling exists
- `tests/feature-flags.test.ts` exists
- Test for feature disabled may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies callback suppression when feature is disabled.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review shouldSendElevenLabsCallback() implementation
- [ ] Review feature disabled logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/feature-flags.test.ts`
- [ ] Use test environment setup and logger mocking

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'shouldSendElevenLabsCallback() returns false and logs when feature disabled'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other ElevenLabs tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test environment
  - [ ] Use `beforeEach` to save original ENABLE_ELEVENLABS env var
  - [ ] Set `ENABLE_ELEVENLABS='false'` to disable feature
  - [ ] Set up logger spy to capture log messages
  - [ ] Use `afterEach` to restore original env var
- [ ] Step 3: Test callback decision when feature disabled
  - [ ] Call `shouldSendElevenLabsCallback()` with ElevenLabs URL
  - [ ] Verify false is returned
  - [ ] Verify log message indicates feature is disabled
- [ ] Step 4: Verify suppression and logging
  - [ ] Assert false is returned
  - [ ] Assert appropriate log message is emitted

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: False is returned
  - Acceptance: Returns false when feature disabled
  - Acceptance: Callback is suppressed
- [ ] Requirement 2: Logging occurs
  - Acceptance: Log message indicates feature disabled
  - Acceptance: Log is helpful for debugging
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/feature-flags.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining feature disabled handling

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify callback suppression works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 13: System Settings, Gmail MCP, Feature Flags
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-13.3.4
- **Dependencies**: TASK-13.3.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Callbacks should be suppressed when feature disabled
  - Logging should explain why callback is suppressed
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-13.3.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/feature-flags.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Callback suppression is verified
4. Logging is verified
5. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
6. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
7. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want callback suppression so ElevenLabs callbacks are blocked when disabled
- As a **system**, I want logging so suppression is traceable

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies false is returned when feature disabled
- Test verifies logging occurs
- Test passes
- All tests pass

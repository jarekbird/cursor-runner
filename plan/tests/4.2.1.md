# TASK-4.2.1: Test POST /cursor/execute/async returns 400 when callbackUrl is missing

**Section**: 4. HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
**Subsection**: 4.2.1
**Task ID**: TASK-4.2.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-4.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `POST /cursor/execute/async` returns 400 status code when `callbackUrl` is missing from the request body. This ensures proper validation for the async endpoint.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /cursor/execute/async endpoint, validation)

## Current State

- POST /cursor/execute/async endpoint exists
- Validation logic exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for callbackUrl validation may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies input validation for the async endpoint.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /cursor/execute/async endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review validation logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` and `assertErrorResponse()` helpers

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'POST /cursor/execute/async returns 400 when callbackUrl is missing'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for cursor/execute/async endpoint tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test async endpoint without callbackUrl
  - [ ] Make POST request to `/cursor/execute/async` with body: `{ prompt: 'test' }` (no callbackUrl)
  - [ ] Verify response status is 400
  - [ ] Verify response body contains error message about missing callbackUrl
- [ ] Step 4: Verify error response
  - [ ] Use `assertErrorResponse()` helper
  - [ ] Verify error message is clear and actionable

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: 400 status when callbackUrl is missing
  - Acceptance: HTTP status code is 400
  - Acceptance: Error is returned immediately (no background processing)
- [ ] Requirement 2: Error message is clear
  - Acceptance: Error message indicates callbackUrl is required
  - Acceptance: Error message is actionable
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Mocks are properly cleaned up

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: callbackUrl is empty string
  - Verify empty string is treated as missing
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: callbackUrl is null
  - Verify null is treated as missing

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify validation works correctly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining validation
- [ ] Document required fields

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify validation is correct
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 4: HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-4.1.5
- **Dependencies**: TASK-4.1.5, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.5
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - callbackUrl is required for async endpoints
  - Validation should happen before any processing
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-4.1.5

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-4.1.5
- Next: TASK-4.2.2
- Dependencies: TASK-4.1.5, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-1.1.5
- Related:
  - TASK-4.2: POST /cursor/execute/async (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Validation is verified (400 status)
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want validation errors so I know when required fields are missing
- As a **client**, I want clear error messages so I can fix invalid requests

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies 400 status when callbackUrl is missing
- Test verifies error message is clear
- Test passes
- All tests pass

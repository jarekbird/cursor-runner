# TASK-11.1.2: Test ConversationService.getConversationId() no id provided uses last-conversation key per queue type

**Section**: 11. Redis-based Conversation Services
**Subsection**: 11.1.2
**Task ID**: TASK-11.1.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-11.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `ConversationService.getConversationId()` uses the last-conversation key per queue type when no conversationId is provided. This ensures queue-specific conversation tracking works correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/conversation-service.ts` (getConversationId method, queue type handling)

## Current State

- ConversationService.getConversationId() exists
- Queue type handling exists
- `tests/conversation-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for queue-specific last-conversation key may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies queue-specific conversation tracking.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review ConversationService.getConversationId() implementation
- [ ] Review last-conversation key structure per queue type
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'getConversationId() no id provided uses last-conversation key per queue type'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other getConversationId tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper
  - [ ] Mock Redis to return test conversation ID for last-conversation key
  - [ ] Set up different queue types for testing
- [ ] Step 3: Test queue-specific last-conversation
  - [ ] Test case 1: Call `getConversationId()` with queueType: 'api', no explicit ID
  - [ ] Verify last-conversation key for 'api' queue is queried
  - [ ] Verify returned ID matches last-conversation key value
  - [ ] Test case 2: Call `getConversationId()` with queueType: 'telegram', no explicit ID
  - [ ] Verify last-conversation key for 'telegram' queue is queried
  - [ ] Verify different queue types use different keys
- [ ] Step 4: Verify queue-specific behavior
  - [ ] Assert correct last-conversation key is queried per queue type
  - [ ] Assert queue types are isolated (different keys)

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Last-conversation key is used
  - Acceptance: Last-conversation key is queried when no explicit ID provided
  - Acceptance: Returned ID matches last-conversation key value
- [ ] Requirement 2: Queue types are isolated
  - Acceptance: Different queue types use different last-conversation keys
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Last-conversation key doesn't exist (verify handling - may create new conversation)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining queue-specific tracking

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify queue-specific tracking works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 11: Redis-based Conversation Services
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-11.1.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-11.1.1, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Queue types should have separate last-conversation keys
  - Keys should be isolated per queue type
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-11.1.1

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-11.1.1
- Next: TASK-11.1.3
- Dependencies: TASK-11.1.1, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4
- Related:
  - TASK-11.1: ConversationService - getConversationId (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Queue-specific tracking is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want queue-specific tracking so conversations are isolated by queue
- As a **system**, I want queue isolation so different queues don't interfere

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies last-conversation key is used per queue type
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-2.3.1: Test initialize() continues when migrations throw

**Section**: 2. Core Application Lifecycle
**Subsection**: 2.3.1
**Task ID**: TASK-2.3.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-2.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `initialize()` continues startup even when `runMigrations()` throws an error. This ensures migration failures don't block the application from starting, implementing graceful degradation.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/index.ts` (initialize method, migration error handling)

## Current State

- `initialize()` method exists
- Migration system exists
- `tests/index.test.ts` exists
- Test for migration failure handling may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies graceful degradation when migrations fail.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `initialize()` implementation
- [ ] Review migration error handling logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Understand how migration errors are caught and handled

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'initialize() continues when migrations throw'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for migration failure tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Create CursorRunner instance
  - [ ] Mock `runMigrations()` to throw an error
  - [ ] Mock other dependencies (GitHubAuthService, cursorCLI, server)
  - [ ] Set up logger spy to capture log messages
- [ ] Step 3: Test initialization
  - [ ] Call `initialize()` method
  - [ ] Verify initialize() completes successfully (doesn't throw)
  - [ ] Verify error is logged with warning message
  - [ ] Verify log contains "Continuing startup despite migration failure"
- [ ] Step 4: Verify startup continues
  - [ ] Verify `server.start()` is still called
  - [ ] Verify other initialization steps complete
  - [ ] Verify initialize() resolves successfully

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Migration errors don't block startup
  - Acceptance: initialize() completes successfully even when migrations throw
  - Acceptance: No exception is propagated from initialize()
- [ ] Requirement 2: Error is logged appropriately
  - Acceptance: Warning is logged when migration fails
  - Acceptance: Log message indicates startup is continuing
- [ ] Requirement 3: Startup continues normally
  - Acceptance: server.start() is called
  - Acceptance: Other initialization steps complete

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Multiple migration errors
  - Verify only one warning is logged (if applicable)
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: Migration error after some migrations succeed
  - Verify partial migration state is handled

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:unit`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify error is logged with warning
- [ ] Verify server.start() is called
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining graceful degradation behavior
- [ ] Document why migrations failures don't block startup

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify graceful degradation works
- [ ] Verify warning is logged appropriately
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: Core Application Lifecycle
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-2.2.8
- **Dependencies**: TASK-2.2.8
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Migrations are non-critical - app can run without them
  - Error should be logged but not block startup
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-2.2.8

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-2.2.8
- Next: TASK-2.4.1
- Dependencies: TASK-2.2.8

  - TASK-2.3: CursorRunner.initialize() - Migration Failure Handling (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/index.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Graceful degradation is verified
4. Warning logging is verified
5. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
6. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
7. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want the app to start even if migrations fail so I can debug issues
- As a **system**, I want graceful degradation so non-critical failures don't prevent startup

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies initialize() completes when migrations throw
- Test verifies error is logged with warning
- Test verifies server.start() is still called
- Test passes
- All tests pass

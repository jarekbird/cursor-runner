# TASK-10.3.1: Test CursorCLI PTY is used when node-pty is available

**Section**: 10. CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
**Subsection**: 10.3.1
**Task ID**: TASK-10.3.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-10.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorCLI.executeCommand()` uses PTY when `node-pty` module is available. This ensures PTY is preferred over spawn when available.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-cli.ts` (executeCommand method, PTY detection and usage)

## Current State

- CursorCLI.executeCommand() exists
- PTY detection exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts` exists
- Test for PTY usage may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies PTY detection and usage.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorCLI.executeCommand() implementation
- [ ] Review how node-pty is detected
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'PTY is used when node-pty is available'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for CursorCLI PTY vs Spawn tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `node-pty` module to be available
  - [ ] Mock PTY creation to track usage
- [ ] Step 3: Test PTY usage
  - [ ] Call `executeCommand()` with test command
  - [ ] Verify PTY is created (not spawn)
  - [ ] Verify PTY is used for command execution
- [ ] Step 4: Verify PTY usage
  - [ ] Assert PTY is created
  - [ ] Assert spawn is not used
  - [ ] Assert PTY methods are called

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: PTY is used when available
  - Acceptance: PTY is created when node-pty is available
  - Acceptance: PTY is used for execution
- [ ] Requirement 2: Spawn is not used
  - Acceptance: spawn is not called when PTY is available
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: node-pty is available but PTY creation fails (verify fallback)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining PTY usage

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify PTY is used correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 10: CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-10.2.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-10.2.3, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - PTY should be preferred when available
  - PTY provides better terminal emulation
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-10.2.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-10.2.3
- Next: TASK-10.3.2
- Dependencies: TASK-10.2.3, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-10.3: CursorCLI - PTY vs Spawn (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. PTY usage is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want PTY used when available so I get better terminal emulation
- As a **system**, I want PTY so interactive commands work correctly

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies PTY is used when node-pty is available
- Test passes
- All tests pass

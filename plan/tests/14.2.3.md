# TASK-14.2.3: Test FileTreeService.buildFileTree() handles nested directories

**Section**: 14. Filesystem & Workspace Services
**Subsection**: 14.2.3
**Task ID**: TASK-14.2.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-14.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `FileTreeService.buildFileTree()` correctly handles nested directories and builds a proper tree structure. This ensures file tree generation works for complex directory structures.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/file-tree-service.ts` (buildFileTree method)

## Current State

- FileTreeService.buildFileTree() exists
- Tree building logic exists
- `tests/file-tree-service.test.ts` exists (or needs to be created)
- Test for nested directories may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies file tree generation for nested structures.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review FileTreeService.buildFileTree() implementation
- [ ] Review tree building logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/file-tree-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use test filesystem mocking

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'buildFileTree() handles nested directories'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for FileTreeService tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test data
  - [ ] Mock filesystem to return nested directory structure
  - [ ] Create test structure: root/ -> subdir1/ -> subdir2/ -> file.txt
- [ ] Step 3: Test buildFileTree() with nested directories
  - [ ] Call `buildFileTree()` with root directory
  - [ ] Verify tree structure includes nested directories
  - [ ] Verify tree structure is correct (parent-child relationships)
  - [ ] Verify all files and directories are included
- [ ] Step 4: Verify tree structure
  - [ ] Assert nested directories are included
  - [ ] Assert tree structure is correct
  - [ ] Assert all levels are represented

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Nested directories are handled
  - Acceptance: All nested directories are included in tree
  - Acceptance: Tree structure is correct
- [ ] Requirement 2: Tree structure is accurate
  - Acceptance: Parent-child relationships are correct
  - Acceptance: Depth is preserved
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Very deep nesting (verify handling)
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: Empty nested directories (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/file-tree-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining nested directory handling

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify nested directory handling works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 14: Filesystem & Workspace Services
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-14.2.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-14.2.2
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Tree should preserve directory hierarchy
  - Should handle arbitrary nesting depth
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-14.2.2

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-14.2.2
- Next: TASK-14.3.1
- Dependencies: TASK-14.2.2
- Related:
  - TASK-14.2: FilesystemService, FileTreeService, WorkspaceTrustService (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/file-tree-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Nested directory handling is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want nested directory support so complex structures are handled
- As a **client**, I want complete file trees so I can see all files and directories

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies nested directories are handled correctly
- Test passes
- All tests pass

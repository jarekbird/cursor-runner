# TASK-10.2.1: Test CursorCLI main timeout triggers CommandError with stdout/stderr attached

**Section**: 10. CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
**Subsection**: 10.2.1
**Task ID**: TASK-10.2.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-10.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorCLI.executeCommand()` triggers a `CommandError` with stdout and stderr attached when the main timeout is reached. This ensures timeout behavior works correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-cli.ts` (executeCommand method, main timeout handling)

## Current State

- CursorCLI.executeCommand() exists
- Main timeout handling exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts` exists
- Test for main timeout may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies main timeout behavior.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorCLI.executeCommand() implementation
- [ ] Review main timeout configuration
- [ ] Review CommandError structure
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'main timeout triggers CommandError with stdout/stderr attached'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for CursorCLI timeout handling tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test environment
  - [ ] Set main timeout to a short test value (e.g., 100ms)
  - [ ] Use `beforeEach` to save original value
  - [ ] Use `afterEach` to restore original value
- [ ] Step 3: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockCursorCLI()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `child_process.spawn` to simulate long-running command that exceeds timeout
  - [ ] Mock process output to include stdout and stderr
- [ ] Step 4: Test timeout behavior
  - [ ] Call `executeCommand()` with test command
  - [ ] Wait for timeout to trigger
  - [ ] Verify CommandError is thrown
  - [ ] Verify CommandError includes stdout and stderr
  - [ ] Verify error message indicates timeout
- [ ] Step 5: Verify timeout error
  - [ ] Assert CommandError is thrown
  - [ ] Assert stdout is attached
  - [ ] Assert stderr is attached
  - [ ] Assert error indicates timeout

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Timeout triggers CommandError
  - Acceptance: CommandError is thrown when timeout is reached
  - Acceptance: Error indicates timeout occurred
- [ ] Requirement 2: Output is attached
  - Acceptance: CommandError includes stdout
  - Acceptance: CommandError includes stderr
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Env var is restored after test

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Command completes just before timeout (verify no timeout error)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify timeout behavior works correctly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining timeout behavior

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify timeout behavior works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 10: CLI Wrapper & Child Process Handling
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-10.1.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-10.1.3, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Main timeout should trigger CommandError
  - Output should be preserved in error
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-10.1.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-10.1.3
- Next: TASK-10.2.2
- Dependencies: TASK-10.1.3, TASK-1.1.3, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-10.2: CursorCLI - Timeout Handling (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-cli.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Main timeout behavior is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want timeout errors so I know when commands take too long
- As a **system**, I want timeouts so commands don't run indefinitely

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies main timeout triggers CommandError
- Test verifies stdout/stderr are attached
- Test passes
- All tests pass

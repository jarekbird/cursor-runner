# TASK-11.2.2: Test ConversationService.forceNewConversation() clears last-conversation key and creates new

**Section**: 11. Redis-based Conversation Services
**Subsection**: 11.2.2
**Task ID**: TASK-11.2.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-11.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `ConversationService.forceNewConversation()` clears the last-conversation key and creates a new conversation. This ensures forced new conversations work correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/conversation-service.ts` (forceNewConversation method)

## Current State

- ConversationService.forceNewConversation() exists
- Last-conversation key clearing exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/conversation-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for forceNewConversation may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies forced new conversation creation.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review ConversationService.forceNewConversation() implementation
- [ ] Review last-conversation key clearing logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'forceNewConversation() clears last-conversation key and creates new'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other conversation management tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper
  - [ ] Set up existing last-conversation key in Redis mock
  - [ ] Track key deletion and creation operations
- [ ] Step 3: Test forceNewConversation
  - [ ] Call `forceNewConversation()` with queueType: 'api'
  - [ ] Verify last-conversation key is deleted/cleared
  - [ ] Verify new conversation is created
  - [ ] Verify new conversation ID is returned
  - [ ] Verify last-conversation key is set to new conversation ID
- [ ] Step 4: Verify forced new conversation
  - [ ] Assert last-conversation key is cleared
  - [ ] Assert new conversation is created
  - [ ] Assert new conversation ID is different from old one

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Last-conversation key is cleared
  - Acceptance: Last-conversation key is deleted/cleared
  - Acceptance: Old conversation ID is removed
- [ ] Requirement 2: New conversation is created
  - Acceptance: New conversation is created
  - Acceptance: New conversation ID is returned
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Last-conversation key doesn't exist (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining forceNewConversation behavior

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify forced new conversation works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 11: Redis-based Conversation Services
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-11.2.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-11.2.1, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - forceNewConversation should clear old key and create new
  - New conversation should be independent of old one
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-11.2.1

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/conversation-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Last-conversation key clearing is verified
4. New conversation creation is verified
5. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
6. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
7. Code is pushed to origin

- Test verifies new conversation is created
- Test passes
- All tests pass

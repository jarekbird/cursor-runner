# TASK-2.1.1: Test CursorRunner Constructor with Dependencies

**Section**: 2. Core Application Lifecycle
**Subsection**: 2.1.1
**Task ID**: TASK-2.1.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-2.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorRunner` constructor works correctly when all dependencies are injected. This ensures the constructor accepts and stores dependencies properly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/index.ts` (CursorRunner class)

## Current State

- `CursorRunner` class exists with constructor
- `tests/index.test.ts` exists but may not have constructor test
- Dependencies include: Server, CursorCLI, Redis, etc.

**Important**: This is the first test in Phase 2.1 and establishes the testing pattern for CursorRunner.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `CursorRunner` constructor signature
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Understand dependency injection pattern
- [ ] Review test helpers from Phase 1.1

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'constructor with all dependencies injected'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for CursorRunner constructor tests
- [ ] Step 2: Create mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper
  - [ ] Create mocks for other dependencies as needed
- [ ] Step 3: Test constructor
  - [ ] Create CursorRunner instance with all mocks
  - [ ] Verify instance is created without errors
  - [ ] Verify dependencies are stored correctly
- [ ] Step 4: Verify dependencies
  - [ ] Assert that dependencies are accessible on instance
  - [ ] Verify dependency types are correct

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Constructor accepts all dependencies
  - Acceptance: No errors when creating instance
- [ ] Requirement 2: Dependencies are stored correctly
  - Acceptance: Can access dependencies from instance
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Missing optional dependencies
  - Verify constructor handles optional dependencies correctly

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:unit` (or appropriate script)
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining what is being tested
- [ ] Document any assumptions about dependencies

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests
- [ ] Verify test is maintainable

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: Core Application Lifecycle
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after Phase 1 (test helpers)
- **Dependencies**: TASK-1.1.4 (createMockServer helper)
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Use test helpers from Phase 1.1
  - Follow existing test patterns
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after Phase 1

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/index.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
4. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
5. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want to verify the constructor works so I know dependencies are injected correctly
- As a **test suite**, I want constructor tests so I can catch dependency injection issues early

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies constructor accepts dependencies
- Test verifies dependencies are stored
- Test passes
- All tests pass

### Step 17.1: Test Sharing Strategy
**Objective**: Ensure tests are shared or synchronized across cursor-runner copies.

This task has been broken down into granular subtasks:

1. [TASK-17.1.1](./17.1.1.md): Document test sharing strategy
2. [TASK-17.1.2](./17.1.2.md): Verify tests run in all repos

**Note**: Complete all subtasks in order (17.1.1 → 17.1.2). Each subtask is independently completable with its own Definition of Done.

**Original Tasks**:
1. Document strategy:
   - Decide: symlinks, submodule, or manual sync
   - Create sync script if manual sync chosen
   - Document process for keeping tests in sync

2. Verify other repos:
   - Check `assistant-integrations/cursor-runner` and `python-cursor/cursor-runner`
   - Ensure they can run the same test suite
   - Document any differences

**Tests**:
- Verify tests run in all repos
- Verify sync process works

**Verification**:
- Strategy is documented
- Tests are accessible in all repos

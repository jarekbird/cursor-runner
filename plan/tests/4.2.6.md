# TASK-4.2.6: Test POST /cursor/execute/async logs callback errors but doesn't crash

**Section**: 4. HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
**Subsection**: 4.2.6
**Task ID**: TASK-4.2.6
**Parent Task**: TASK-4.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `POST /cursor/execute/async` logs callback errors but doesn't crash when the callback webhook fails. This ensures the system is resilient to callback failures.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /cursor/execute/async endpoint, callback error handling), `src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (callbackWebhook error handling)

## Current State

- POST /cursor/execute/async endpoint exists
- Callback error handling exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for callback error handling may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies graceful handling of callback failures.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /cursor/execute/async endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review callback error handling logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
- [ ] Understand how to mock HTTP request failures

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'POST /cursor/execute/async logs callback errors but doesn't crash'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other cursor/execute/async tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `cursorExecution.execute()` to return success
  - [ ] Mock HTTP client (fetch or axios) to throw error or return error response
  - [ ] Set up logger spy to capture log messages
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test async endpoint with callback failure
  - [ ] Make POST request to `/cursor/execute/async` with valid body
  - [ ] Wait for background processing to complete
  - [ ] Verify callback error is logged
  - [ ] Verify no exception is thrown (system doesn't crash)
- [ ] Step 4: Verify error handling
  - [ ] Assert error is logged
  - [ ] Assert log message indicates callback failure
  - [ ] Assert no exception is propagated
  - [ ] Assert system continues to operate normally

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Callback errors are logged
  - Acceptance: Logger is called with error information
  - Acceptance: Error message is clear
- [ ] Requirement 2: System doesn't crash
  - Acceptance: No exception is thrown
  - Acceptance: System continues to operate
  - Acceptance: No unhandled promise rejections
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Mocks are properly cleaned up

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Network timeout
  - Verify timeout errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: HTTP error status (4xx, 5xx)
  - Verify HTTP errors are handled gracefully

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify error is logged
- [ ] Verify no crashes occur
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining error handling
- [ ] Document why callback errors don't crash the system

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify graceful error handling works
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 4: HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-4.2.5
- **Dependencies**: TASK-4.2.5, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Callback failures shouldn't crash the system
  - Errors should be logged for debugging
  - System should continue operating normally
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-4.2.5

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-4.2.5
- Next: TASK-4.3.1
- Dependencies: TASK-4.2.5, TASK-1.1.4
- Related:
  - TASK-4.2: POST /cursor/execute/async (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Error logging is verified
4. No crash behavior is verified
5. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
6. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
7. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want callback errors logged so I can debug callback issues
- As a **system**, I want to handle callback failures gracefully so I don't crash

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies callback errors are logged
- Test verifies system doesn't crash on callback failure
- Test passes
- All tests pass

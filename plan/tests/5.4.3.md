# TASK-5.4.3: Test GET /api/tasks passes through to tasks router

**Section**: 5. HTTP Server - Conversation API
**Subsection**: 5.4.3
**Task ID**: TASK-5.4.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-5.4

## Description

Write a test to verify that `GET /api/tasks` passes through to the tasks router instead of being treated as a conversation ID. This ensures route conflicts are avoided.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (route handling, reserved paths)

## Current State

- GET /api/:conversationId endpoint exists
- Tasks router exists
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for reserved path handling may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies reserved paths are handled correctly.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review GET /api/:conversationId endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review tasks router setup
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'GET /api/tasks passes through to tasks router'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other /api/:conversationId tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock tasks router endpoint to return test response
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test reserved path
  - [ ] Make GET request to `/api/tasks`
  - [ ] Verify request is handled by tasks router (not conversation endpoint)
  - [ ] Verify response is from tasks router
- [ ] Step 4: Verify pass-through
  - [ ] Assert conversation endpoint is not called
  - [ ] Assert tasks router is called
  - [ ] Assert response is from tasks router

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Reserved path is handled correctly
  - Acceptance: /api/tasks is handled by tasks router
  - Acceptance: Conversation endpoint is not called
- [ ] Requirement 2: Route conflict is avoided
  - Acceptance: No route conflicts occur
  - Acceptance: Correct router handles the request
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining reserved paths

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify route conflicts are avoided
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 5: HTTP Server - Conversation API
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-5.4.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-5.4.2, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Reserved paths must be checked before conversation ID matching
  - Route order matters
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-5.4.2

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-5.4.2
- Next: TASK-5.4.4
- Dependencies: TASK-5.4.2, TASK-1.1.4
- Related:
  - TASK-5.4: GET /api/:conversationId (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Reserved path handling is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want reserved paths to work so route conflicts don't occur
- As a **system**, I want correct routing so requests go to the right handlers

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies /api/tasks passes through to tasks router
- Test passes
- All tests pass

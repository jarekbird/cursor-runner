# TASK-4.4.4: Test POST /cursor/iterate/async processes iteration in background

**Section**: 4. HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
**Subsection**: 4.4.4
**Task ID**: TASK-4.4.4
**Parent Task**: TASK-4.4

## Description

Write a test to verify that `POST /cursor/iterate/async` processes iteration in the background after returning the immediate response. This ensures background processing actually happens.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /cursor/iterate/async endpoint, background processing)

## Current State

- POST /cursor/iterate/async endpoint exists
- Background processing exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for background processing may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies background iteration actually occurs.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /cursor/iterate/async endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review how background processing is implemented
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'POST /cursor/iterate/async processes iteration in background'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other cursor/iterate/async tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `cursorExecution.iterate()` to track when it's called
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test async iterate endpoint
  - [ ] Make POST request to `/cursor/iterate/async` with valid body
  - [ ] Verify immediate 200 response
  - [ ] Wait for background processing (use setTimeout or waitFor)
  - [ ] Verify iterate() was called
- [ ] Step 4: Verify background processing
  - [ ] Assert iterate() is called after response is sent
  - [ ] Assert iterate() is called with correct parameters
  - [ ] Use appropriate waiting mechanism

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Background processing happens
  - Acceptance: iterate() is called after response is sent
  - Acceptance: iterate() is called with correct parameters
- [ ] Requirement 2: Processing is asynchronous
  - Acceptance: Response is sent before iterate() is called
  - Acceptance: Processing doesn't block the response
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Mocks are properly cleaned up
  - Acceptance: No hanging promises or timers

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: iterate() throws
  - Verify error is handled in background (may be separate test - TASK-4.4.5)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify background processing works
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining background processing
- [ ] Document waiting mechanism used in test

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify background processing works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests
- [ ] Verify no hanging processes or timers

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 4: HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-4.4.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-4.4.3, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Background processing should happen after response
  - Need to wait appropriately in test to verify processing
  - Clean up any timers or promises
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-4.4.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-4.4.3
- Next: TASK-4.4.5
- Dependencies: TASK-4.4.3, TASK-1.1.4
- Related:
  - TASK-4.4: POST /cursor/iterate/async (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Background processing is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want background processing so long-running iterations don't block requests
- As a **system**, I want async iteration so I can handle multiple requests concurrently

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies iterate() is called in background
- Test verifies processing happens after response
- Test passes
- All tests pass

### Step 2.3: CursorRunner.initialize() - Migration Failure Handling
**Objective**: Ensure migrations failures don't block startup.

This task has been broken down into granular subtasks:

1. [TASK-2.3.1](./2.3.1.md): Test initialize() continues when migrations throw

**Note**: Complete the subtask. Each subtask is independently completable with its own Definition of Done.

**Original Tasks**:
1. Extend `tests/index.test.ts`:
   - Add test: `initialize()` continues when migrations throw
   - Mock `runMigrations()` to throw an error
   - Verify error is logged with warning message
   - Verify startup continues and `server.start()` is still called
   - Verify log contains "Continuing startup despite migration failure"

**Tests**:
- Mock `runMigrations` to throw
- Capture logger calls to verify warning is logged
- Verify `server.start()` is still called

**Verification**:
- Test passes and confirms graceful degradation
- Warning is logged appropriately
- Server still starts successfully

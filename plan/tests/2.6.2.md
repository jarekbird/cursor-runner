# TASK-2.6.2: Test shutdown() logs memory usage

**Section**: 2. Core Application Lifecycle
**Subsection**: 2.6.2
**Task ID**: TASK-2.6.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-2.6

## Description

Write a test to verify that `shutdown()` logs memory usage information during shutdown. This ensures diagnostic information is available for troubleshooting.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/index.ts` (shutdown method, memory usage logging)

## Current State

- `shutdown()` method exists
- Logger is used throughout the codebase
- `tests/index.test.ts` exists
- Test for memory usage logging may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies diagnostic logging during shutdown.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `shutdown()` implementation
- [ ] Review how memory usage is calculated (process.memoryUsage())
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Understand logger usage patterns

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'shutdown() logs memory usage'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other shutdown tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Create CursorRunner instance
  - [ ] Set up logger spy to capture log messages
  - [ ] Mock server.stop() to prevent actual server operations
- [ ] Step 3: Test shutdown
  - [ ] Call `shutdown()` method
  - [ ] Verify logger was called with memory usage information
  - [ ] Verify log message contains memory metrics
- [ ] Step 4: Verify log content
  - [ ] Assert logger.info() or logger.debug() was called
  - [ ] Assert log message contains memory usage data
  - [ ] Assert memory values are present (heapUsed, heapTotal, etc.)

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Memory usage is logged
  - Acceptance: Logger is called with memory information
  - Acceptance: Memory metrics are included in log
- [ ] Requirement 2: Log message is informative
  - Acceptance: Message contains memory usage data
  - Acceptance: Message is clear and readable
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Logger spy is properly cleaned up

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: process.memoryUsage() is unavailable
  - Verify graceful handling (if applicable)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:unit`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify memory usage is logged
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining what is being tested
- [ ] Document expected log message format

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify memory usage is logged
- [ ] Verify log message is informative
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: Core Application Lifecycle
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-2.6.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-2.6.1
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Memory usage logging helps with diagnostics
  - Log level should be appropriate (info or debug)
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-2.6.1

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/index.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Memory usage logging is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want to see memory usage during shutdown so I can diagnose memory issues
- As an **operator**, I want memory usage logged so I can monitor resource usage

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies memory usage is logged
- Test verifies log message contains memory metrics
- Test passes
- All tests pass

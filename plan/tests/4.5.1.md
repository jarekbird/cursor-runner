# TASK-4.5.1: Test POST /cursor/conversation/new creates new conversation with default queue type

**Section**: 4. HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
**Subsection**: 4.5.1
**Task ID**: TASK-4.5.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-4.5

## Description

Write a test to verify that `POST /cursor/conversation/new` creates a new conversation with the default queue type when no queueType is provided. This ensures conversation creation works with defaults.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /cursor/conversation/new endpoint), `src/conversation-service.ts` (forceNewConversation method)

## Current State

- POST /cursor/conversation/new endpoint exists
- ConversationService.forceNewConversation() exists
- `tests/server.test.ts` exists
- Test for conversation creation may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies conversation creation with default queue type.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /cursor/conversation/new endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review ConversationService.forceNewConversation() method
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` and `createMockRedisClient()` helpers

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'POST /cursor/conversation/new creates new conversation with default queue type'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for cursor/conversation/new endpoint tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `conversationService.forceNewConversation()` to return conversation ID
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 3: Test conversation creation endpoint
  - [ ] Make POST request to `/cursor/conversation/new` with body: `{}` (no queueType)
  - [ ] Verify response status is 200
  - [ ] Verify response contains conversation ID
  - [ ] Verify forceNewConversation() was called with default queue type
- [ ] Step 4: Verify default queue type
  - [ ] Assert forceNewConversation() receives default queue type
  - [ ] Assert default queue type is correct (verify expected default)

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Conversation is created
  - Acceptance: forceNewConversation() is called
  - Acceptance: Conversation ID is returned
- [ ] Requirement 2: Default queue type is used
  - Acceptance: Default queue type is passed to forceNewConversation()
  - Acceptance: Default value is correct
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Mocks are properly cleaned up

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify conversation creation works correctly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining conversation creation
- [ ] Document default queue type

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify conversation creation works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 4: HTTP Server - Cursor Execution Routes
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-4.4.5
- **Dependencies**: TASK-4.4.5, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Default queue type should be appropriate
  - Conversation creation should be idempotent (if applicable)
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-4.4.5

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-4.4.5
- Next: TASK-4.5.2
- Dependencies: TASK-4.4.5, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/server.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Conversation creation is verified
4. Default queue type is verified
5. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
6. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
7. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want to create new conversations so I can start fresh conversations
- As a **client**, I want default queue type so I don't have to specify it

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies conversation is created with default queue type
- Test passes
- All tests pass

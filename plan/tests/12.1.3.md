# TASK-12.1.3: Test TaskService.createTask() creates with timestamps and correct status_label

**Section**: 12. Persistence & Migrations
**Subsection**: 12.1.3
**Task ID**: TASK-12.1.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-12.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `TaskService.createTask()` creates a task with timestamps (createdat, updatedat) and correct `status_label`. This ensures task creation includes all required fields.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/task-service.ts` (createTask method)

## Current State

- TaskService.createTask() exists
- Timestamp and status_label handling exists
- `tests/task-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for createTask may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies task creation with timestamps and status_label.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review TaskService.createTask() implementation
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/task-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createTempSqliteDb()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'createTask() creates with timestamps and correct status_label'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other basic operations tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test database
  - [ ] Use `createTempSqliteDb()` helper in `beforeAll`
  - [ ] Run migrations to set up schema
- [ ] Step 3: Test task creation
  - [ ] Call `createTask()` with test prompt
  - [ ] Verify task is created in database
  - [ ] Verify task has createdat timestamp
  - [ ] Verify task has updatedat timestamp
  - [ ] Verify task has status_label (computed from status)
- [ ] Step 4: Verify task creation
  - [ ] Assert timestamps are set
  - [ ] Assert status_label is correct

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Timestamps are set
  - Acceptance: createdat is set
  - Acceptance: updatedat is set
- [ ] Requirement 2: status_label is correct
  - Acceptance: status_label matches status value
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/task-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining task creation

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify task creation works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 12: Persistence & Migrations
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-12.1.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-12.1.2, TASK-1.1.2, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Timestamps should be set automatically
  - status_label should be computed from status
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-12.1.2

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-12.1.2
- Next: TASK-12.1.4
- Dependencies: TASK-12.1.2, TASK-1.1.2, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-12.1: TaskService - Basic Operations (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/task-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Task creation is verified
4. Timestamps and status_label are verified
5. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
6. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
7. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want timestamps so I can track when tasks are created
- As a **client**, I want status_label so I can display human-readable status

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies task creation with timestamps and status_label
- Test passes
- All tests pass

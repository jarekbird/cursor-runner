# TASK-9.5.1: Test CursorExecutionService.execute() uses explicit conversationId when provided

**Section**: 9. Execution Orchestration
**Subsection**: 9.5.1
**Task ID**: TASK-9.5.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-9.5

## Description

Write a test to verify that `CursorExecutionService.execute()` uses an explicit `conversationId` when it is provided in the request. This ensures conversation ID handling works correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (execute method, conversationId handling), `src/conversation-service.ts` (getConversationId method)

## Current State

- CursorExecutionService.execute() exists
- ConversationService integration exists
- `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts` exists
- Test for explicit conversationId may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies explicit conversation ID usage.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review CursorExecutionService.execute() implementation
- [ ] Review ConversationService.getConversationId() method
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` and `createMockRedisClient()` helpers

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'execute() uses explicit conversationId when provided'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for CursorExecutionService conversation integration tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Use `createMockRedisClient()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `ConversationService` to track conversationId usage
- [ ] Step 3: Test execute() with explicit conversationId
  - [ ] Call `execute()` with request containing explicit conversationId: 'test-conversation-id'
  - [ ] Verify ConversationService.getConversationId() is NOT called (explicit ID is used)
  - [ ] Verify conversationId 'test-conversation-id' is used
  - [ ] Verify messages are added to the specified conversation
- [ ] Step 4: Verify explicit ID usage
  - [ ] Assert explicit conversationId is used
  - [ ] Assert ConversationService.getConversationId() is not called

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Explicit conversationId is used
  - Acceptance: Provided conversationId is used
  - Acceptance: ConversationService.getConversationId() is not called
- [ ] Requirement 2: Conversation is used correctly
  - Acceptance: Messages are added to specified conversation
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining explicit conversationId handling

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify explicit conversationId is used correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 9: Execution Orchestration
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-9.4.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-9.4.3, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Explicit conversationId should take precedence
  - ConversationService should not be called when ID is provided
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-9.4.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-9.4.3
- Next: TASK-9.5.2
- Dependencies: TASK-9.4.3, TASK-1.1.1, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-9.5: CursorExecutionService - Conversation Integration (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/cursor-execution-service.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Explicit conversationId usage is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want explicit conversationId so I can control which conversation is used
- As a **client**, I want to specify conversationId so I can continue existing conversations

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies explicit conversationId is used
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-2.1.3: Test validateConfig succeeds when CURSOR_CLI_PATH is set

**Section**: 2. Core Application Lifecycle
**Subsection**: 2.1.3
**Task ID**: TASK-2.1.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-2.1

## Description

Write a test to verify that `validateConfig()` succeeds (doesn't throw) when the required `CURSOR_CLI_PATH` environment variable is properly set. This ensures the happy path for configuration validation works.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/index.ts` (validateConfig method)

## Current State

- `validateConfig()` method exists
- `tests/index.test.ts` exists
- Test for successful validation may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies the happy path for configuration validation.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `validateConfig()` implementation
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Understand valid CURSOR_CLI_PATH values

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'validateConfig succeeds when CURSOR_CLI_PATH is set'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other validateConfig tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test environment
  - [ ] Use `beforeEach` to save original env var value
  - [ ] Set `CURSOR_CLI_PATH` to a valid value (e.g., '/usr/bin/cursor' or 'cursor')
  - [ ] Use `afterEach` to restore original env var
- [ ] Step 3: Test validation
  - [ ] Create CursorRunner instance (or call validateConfig directly)
  - [ ] Verify no error is thrown
  - [ ] Verify method completes successfully
- [ ] Step 4: Verify success
  - [ ] Assert no exception is thrown
  - [ ] Assert method returns expected value (if applicable)

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: No error is thrown when CURSOR_CLI_PATH is set
  - Acceptance: Test passes when env var is set
  - Acceptance: No exceptions are thrown
- [ ] Requirement 2: Validation completes successfully
  - Acceptance: Method executes without errors
  - Acceptance: Returns expected value (if applicable)
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Env var is restored after test

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: CURSOR_CLI_PATH points to non-existent file
  - Verify if this is validated (may be separate test)
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: CURSOR_CLI_PATH is relative path
  - Verify if relative paths are accepted

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:unit`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining what is being tested
- [ ] Document valid CURSOR_CLI_PATH values

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests
- [ ] Verify test is maintainable

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: Core Application Lifecycle
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-2.1.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-2.1.2
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Must properly clean up env vars
  - Test should verify success path clearly
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-2.1.2

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/index.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
4. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
5. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want validation to succeed when config is correct so I know the system is properly configured
- As a **system**, I want to verify config is valid before starting so I can run successfully

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies no error is thrown when CURSOR_CLI_PATH is set
- Test passes
- All tests pass

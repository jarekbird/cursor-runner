# TASK-2.5.1: Test verifyMcpConfig() logs warning when mcp.json is missing

**Section**: 2. Core Application Lifecycle
**Subsection**: 2.5.1
**Task ID**: TASK-2.5.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-2.5

## Description

Write a test to verify that `verifyMcpConfig()` logs a warning when `/root/.cursor/mcp.json` is missing. This ensures developers are informed when MCP configuration is not set up.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/index.ts` (verifyMcpConfig method)

## Current State

- `verifyMcpConfig()` method exists
- `tests/index.test.ts` exists
- Test for MCP config verification may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies logging behavior when MCP config is missing.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `verifyMcpConfig()` implementation
- [ ] Review how file existence is checked (fs.existsSync)
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Understand logger usage patterns

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'verifyMcpConfig() logs warning when mcp.json is missing'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for MCP config verification tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Create CursorRunner instance
  - [ ] Mock `fs.existsSync` to return false for `/root/.cursor/mcp.json`
  - [ ] Set up logger spy to capture log messages
- [ ] Step 3: Test verification
  - [ ] Call `verifyMcpConfig()` method (or call initialize() which calls it)
  - [ ] Verify warning is logged
  - [ ] Verify log message mentions mcp.json is missing
  - [ ] Verify log message contains helpful suggestions
- [ ] Step 4: Verify log level
  - [ ] Assert logger.warn() was called (not logger.info() or logger.error())
  - [ ] Assert log message is informative

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Warning is logged when file is missing
  - Acceptance: logger.warn() is called
  - Acceptance: Warning is logged at appropriate time
- [ ] Requirement 2: Log message is informative
  - Acceptance: Message mentions mcp.json is missing
  - Acceptance: Message suggests how to fix the issue
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: fs mock is properly cleaned up

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: File path variations
  - Verify correct path is checked
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: Directory exists but file doesn't
  - Verify behavior when directory exists

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/index.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:unit`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify warning is logged
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining what is being tested
- [ ] Document expected log message format

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify warning is logged appropriately
- [ ] Verify log message is helpful
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: Core Application Lifecycle
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-2.4.2
- **Dependencies**: TASK-2.4.2
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - MCP config is optional - warning is appropriate, not error
  - Log message should help developers set up MCP
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-2.4.2

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-2.4.2
- Next: TASK-2.5.2
- Dependencies: TASK-2.4.2

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/index.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Warning logging is verified
4. Log message is verified to be informative
5. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
6. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
7. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want to be warned when MCP config is missing so I can set it up
- As a **system**, I want to log MCP config status so operators know the configuration state

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies warning is logged when mcp.json is missing
- Test verifies log message is informative
- Test passes
- All tests pass

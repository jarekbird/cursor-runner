### Step 16.3: CI Configuration & Coverage Thresholds
**Objective**: Set up CI test scripts and coverage enforcement.

This task has been broken down into granular subtasks:

1. [TASK-16.3.1](./16.3.1.md): Update package.json scripts for test organization
2. [TASK-16.3.2](./16.3.2.md): Update jest.config.js coverage thresholds

**Note**: Complete all subtasks in order (16.3.1 → 16.3.2). Each subtask is independently completable with its own Definition of Done.

**Original Tasks**:
1. Update `package.json` scripts:
   - Ensure `test:unit`, `test:integration`, `test:e2e` are properly configured
   - Add `test:smoke` for opt-in tests
   - Verify scripts work in CI environment

2. Update `jest.config.js`:
   - Raise coverage thresholds gradually (e.g., `lines: 75, branches: 70, functions: 75, statements: 75`)
   - Exclude `index.ts` from coverage requirements
   - Verify coverage report is generated

3. Document CI integration:
   - Update CI configuration files (if any)
   - Document test script usage
   - Document coverage requirements

**Tests**:
- Run all test scripts locally
- Verify coverage thresholds
- Verify CI compatibility

**Verification**:
- All scripts work
- Coverage thresholds are met
- CI is configured

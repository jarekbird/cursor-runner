# TASK-12.3.5: Test MigrationRunner migration failures are logged clearly

**Section**: 12. Persistence & Migrations
**Subsection**: 12.3.5
**Task ID**: TASK-12.3.5
**Parent Task**: TASK-12.3

## Description

Write a test to verify that `MigrationRunner.runMigrations()` logs migration failures clearly. This ensures migration errors are visible and debuggable.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/migrations/` (runMigrations method, error logging)

## Current State

- MigrationRunner.runMigrations() exists
- Error logging exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/migrations.test.ts` exists
- Test for migration failure logging may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies error logging.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review MigrationRunner.runMigrations() implementation
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/migrations.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createTempSqliteDb()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'migration failures are logged clearly'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other migration tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test database
  - [ ] Use `createTempSqliteDb()` helper in `beforeAll`
- [ ] Step 3: Set up logger spy
  - [ ] Set up logger spy to capture log messages
- [ ] Step 4: Test migration failure logging
  - [ ] Create a test migration that fails (or mock migration failure)
  - [ ] Call `runMigrations()`
  - [ ] Verify error is logged
  - [ ] Verify log message is clear and includes migration name
- [ ] Step 5: Verify error logging
  - [ ] Assert error is logged
  - [ ] Assert log message is clear

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Error is logged
  - Acceptance: Migration failure is logged
  - Acceptance: Log includes migration information
- [ ] Requirement 2: Log message is clear
  - Acceptance: Log message indicates which migration failed
  - Acceptance: Log message includes error details
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/migrations.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining error logging

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify error logging works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 12: Persistence & Migrations
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-12.3.4
- **Dependencies**: TASK-12.3.4, TASK-1.1.2, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Error logging should be clear
  - Logs should help debug migration failures
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-12.3.4

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-12.3.4
- Next: TASK-13.1.1
- Dependencies: TASK-12.3.4, TASK-1.1.2, TASK-1.1.4

  - TASK-12.3: Migration Runner (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/migrations.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Error logging is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want clear error logs so I can debug migration failures
- As an **operator**, I want error visibility so I know when migrations fail

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies migration failures are logged clearly
- Test passes
- All tests pass

# TASK-15.1.1: Test full async iteration E2E flow from request to callback

**Section**: 15. E2E-lite Flows
**Subsection**: 15.1.1
**Task ID**: TASK-15.1.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-15.1

## Description

Write an E2E-lite test to verify the full async iteration workflow from `/cursor/iterate/async` request through to callback webhook. This ensures the complete flow works end-to-end with mocked dependencies.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (POST /cursor/iterate/async endpoint), `src/cursor-execution-service.ts` (iterate method, callbackWebhook method)

## Current State

- POST /cursor/iterate/async endpoint exists
- CursorExecutionService.iterate() exists
- Callback webhook functionality exists
- `tests/e2e/async-iteration.test.ts` exists (or needs to be created)
- E2E-lite test for async iteration may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies complete E2E flow with mocked dependencies.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review POST /cursor/iterate/async endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review CursorExecutionService.iterate() method
- [ ] Review callback webhook implementation
- [ ] Review existing E2E test patterns
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Create `tests/e2e/async-iteration.test.ts` if it doesn't exist
  - [ ] Add test: `'Full flow from /cursor/iterate/async request to callback webhook'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for async iteration E2E tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Mock `CursorExecutionService.iterate()` to simulate successful iteration
  - [ ] Mock HTTP client to capture callback requests
  - [ ] Set up in-process HTTP server to receive callback
- [ ] Step 3: Test full E2E flow
  - [ ] Make POST request to `/cursor/iterate/async` with test payload and callbackUrl
  - [ ] Verify immediate 200 response
  - [ ] Wait for background processing to complete
  - [ ] Verify callback webhook is sent to callbackUrl
  - [ ] Verify callback payload structure matches expected format
- [ ] Step 4: Verify E2E flow
  - [ ] Assert immediate response is 200
  - [ ] Assert callback is sent
  - [ ] Assert callback payload is correct

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: E2E flow works
  - Acceptance: Request → Processing → Callback flow completes
  - Acceptance: All steps execute correctly
- [ ] Requirement 2: Callback payload is correct
  - Acceptance: Payload includes all required fields
  - Acceptance: Payload structure matches expected format
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: No real cursor-cli process is spawned

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: Callback failure (verify handling)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/e2e/async-iteration.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:e2e`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining E2E flow

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify E2E flow works correctly
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 15: E2E-lite Flows
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-14.3.3
- **Dependencies**: TASK-14.3.3, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-9.4.3
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Should use mocked dependencies (no real cursor-cli)
  - Should verify complete flow
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-14.3.3

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-14.3.3
- Next: TASK-15.2.1
- Dependencies: TASK-14.3.3, TASK-1.1.4, TASK-9.4.3

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/e2e/async-iteration.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. E2E flow is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want E2E tests so I can verify complete workflows
- As a **system**, I want verified flows so end-to-end behavior is correct

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies full async iteration E2E flow
- Test passes
- All tests pass

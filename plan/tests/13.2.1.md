# TASK-13.2.1: Test getGmailMcpEnabled() returns false when env not set

**Section**: 13. System Settings, Gmail MCP, Feature Flags
**Subsection**: 13.2.1
**Task ID**: TASK-13.2.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-13.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `getGmailMcpEnabled()` returns false when the `ENABLE_GMAIL_MCP` environment variable is not set. This ensures default behavior is correct.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/system-settings-gmail-validation.ts` (getGmailMcpEnabled method)

## Current State

- getGmailMcpEnabled() exists
- Environment variable reading exists
- `tests/system-settings-gmail-validation.test.ts` exists (or needs to be created)
- Test for env not set may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies default behavior.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review getGmailMcpEnabled() implementation
- [ ] Review environment variable reading logic
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/system-settings-gmail-validation.test.ts`
- [ ] Use test environment setup

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'getGmailMcpEnabled() returns false when env not set'`
  - [ ] Use `describe` block for Gmail MCP configuration tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test environment
  - [ ] Use `beforeEach` to save original ENABLE_GMAIL_MCP env var
  - [ ] Delete `ENABLE_GMAIL_MCP` from `process.env`
  - [ ] Use `afterEach` to restore original env var
- [ ] Step 3: Test getGmailMcpEnabled() without env var
  - [ ] Call `getGmailMcpEnabled()`
  - [ ] Verify false is returned
  - [ ] Verify no error is thrown
- [ ] Step 4: Verify default behavior
  - [ ] Assert false is returned
  - [ ] Assert no exception is thrown

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: False is returned
  - Acceptance: Returns false when env var not set
  - Acceptance: Default behavior is safe
- [ ] Requirement 2: Handling is graceful
  - Acceptance: No error is thrown
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests
  - Acceptance: Env var is restored after test

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/system-settings-gmail-validation.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining default behavior

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify default behavior is correct
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 13: System Settings, Gmail MCP, Feature Flags
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-13.1.4
- **Dependencies**: TASK-13.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Default should be false (feature disabled)
  - Must properly clean up env vars
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-13.1.4

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/system-settings-gmail-validation.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Default behavior is verified
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want false default so Gmail MCP is opt-in
- As a **system**, I want safe defaults so features are disabled by default

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies false is returned when env not set
- Test passes
- All tests pass

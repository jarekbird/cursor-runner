# TASK-7.2.2: Test GET /api/tasks?status=0 returns only ready tasks

**Section**: 7. HTTP Server - Tasks API
**Subsection**: 7.2.2
**Task ID**: TASK-7.2.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-7.2

## Description

Write a test to verify that `GET /api/tasks?status=0` returns only tasks with status 0 (ready). This ensures status filtering works correctly.

**Reference Implementation**: `virtual-assistant/cursor-runner/src/server.ts` (GET /api/tasks endpoint, status filter), `src/task-service.ts` (listTasks method with status filter)

## Current State

- GET /api/tasks endpoint exists
- Status filtering exists (or needs to be implemented)
- `tests/tasks-api.test.ts` exists
- Test for status=0 filtering may not exist yet

**Important**: This test verifies status filtering functionality.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review GET /api/tasks endpoint implementation
- [ ] Review TaskService.listTasks() status filtering
- [ ] Review existing tests in `tests/tasks-api.test.ts`
- [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test structure
  - [ ] Add test: `'GET /api/tasks?status=0 returns only ready tasks'`
  - [ ] Use same `describe` block as other /api/tasks tests
- [ ] Step 2: Set up test data
  - [ ] Use `beforeEach` to create test tasks
  - [ ] Create tasks with status 0 (ready)
  - [ ] Create tasks with status 1 (complete) to verify filtering
- [ ] Step 3: Set up mocks
  - [ ] Use `createMockServer()` helper
  - [ ] Use `supertest` to create request client
- [ ] Step 4: Test endpoint with status=0 filter
  - [ ] Make GET request to `/api/tasks?status=0`
  - [ ] Verify response status is 200
  - [ ] Verify response contains only tasks with status 0
  - [ ] Verify tasks with status 1 are not included
- [ ] Step 5: Verify filtering
  - [ ] Assert all returned tasks have status 0
  - [ ] Assert no tasks with other statuses are returned
  - [ ] Verify status_label is correct

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Only ready tasks are returned
  - Acceptance: Response contains only tasks with status 0
  - Acceptance: Tasks with other statuses are excluded
- [ ] Requirement 2: Filtering is accurate
  - Acceptance: All status 0 tasks are included
  - Acceptance: No status 1 tasks are included
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test is isolated
  - Acceptance: Test doesn't affect other tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle edge case 1: No tasks with status 0 (empty array)
- [ ] Handle edge case 2: All tasks have status 0 (all returned)

### Testing

- [ ] Write test in `tests/tasks-api.test.ts`
- [ ] Run test: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify filtering works correctly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Add test comments explaining status filtering

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Verify filtering is accurate
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 7: HTTP Server - Tasks API
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-7.2.1
- **Dependencies**: TASK-7.2.1, TASK-1.1.4
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Status 0 = ready
  - Filtering should be exact match
- **Task Independence**: Can be done after TASK-7.2.1

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-7.2.1
- Next: TASK-7.2.3
- Dependencies: TASK-7.2.1, TASK-1.1.4
- Related:
  - TASK-7.2: GET /api/tasks (parent task)

## Definition of Done

**Definition of Done**: 
1. Test is written in `tests/tasks-api.test.ts`
2. Test passes
3. Status filtering is verified (only status 0 tasks)
4. All checks pass (test, type-check, lint)
5. Code is committed to git with descriptive commit message
6. Code is pushed to origin

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer**, I want status filtering so I can get tasks by status
- As a **client**, I want to filter by status so I can see only ready tasks

**Automated Tests**:
- Test verifies only status 0 tasks are returned
- Test verifies other statuses are excluded
- Test passes
- All tests pass

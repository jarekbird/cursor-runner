# TASK-PY-001.01: Verify Node.js Repository State and Capture Commit SHA

**⚠️ CRITICAL: ALL IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES MUST BE MADE IN THE CURSOR-EXECUTOR APPLICATION ⚠️**

**Target Location**: All code changes, file creations, and modifications described in this task must be implemented in:
- **`python-cursor/cursor-executor/cursor-executor-back/`**

**DO NOT** make changes in:
- `python-cursor/cursor-runner/` (this is the Node.js reference implementation)
- Any other location

The `cursor-executor` application is the Python port target. All Python source code files, tests, configuration files, and documentation should be created or modified within the `cursor-executor-back` directory structure.

**Note**: This particular subtask (TASK-PY-001.01) involves documentation and verification work that may create files in the plan directory, but any baseline documentation should reference the cursor-executor application location.

**Section**: 1. Baseline & Preparation
**Subsection**: 1.1.1
**Task ID**: TASK-PY-001.01
**Parent Task**: TASK-PY-001
**Order**: 1 of 4 (First subtask in TASK-PY-001)

## Description

This subtask verifies the Node.js `cursor-runner` repository is in a clean, known state and captures the exact commit SHA that will serve as the reference point for the Python port. This establishes the baseline commit that all porting work will reference.

**Reference Implementation**: `VirtualAssistant/cursor-runner`, `assistant-integrations/cursor-runner`

## Current State

- No baseline commit SHA has been recorded
- The current state of Node.js repositories is unknown
- Git status of reference repositories is unknown

**Important**: This is the first subtask and must be completed before any other work begins.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Identify the canonical Node.js repository location (`VirtualAssistant/cursor-runner`)
- [ ] Verify git is available and working
- [ ] Navigate to the repository directory

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Check repository state
  - [ ] Navigate to `VirtualAssistant/cursor-runner`
  - [ ] Run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes
  - [ ] Document any uncommitted changes found
- [ ] Step 2: Capture commit information
  - [ ] Run `git rev-parse HEAD` to get current commit SHA
  - [ ] Run `git branch --show-current` to get branch name
  - [ ] Record current date/time
  - [ ] Run `git log -1 --format="%H %s"` to get commit message
- [ ] Step 3: Verify repository is valid
  - [ ] Verify commit SHA is a valid 40-character hash
  - [ ] Verify branch exists
  - [ ] Check that repository has commit history

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Clean repository state
  - Acceptance criteria: `git status` shows clean working tree OR uncommitted changes are documented
  - Acceptance criteria: No critical uncommitted changes that would affect porting
- [ ] Requirement 2: Valid commit SHA captured
  - Acceptance criteria: Commit SHA is a valid 40-character hexadecimal string
  - Acceptance criteria: Commit SHA can be checked out successfully
- [ ] Requirement 3: Information recorded
  - Acceptance criteria: Commit SHA, branch name, and date are recorded
  - Acceptance criteria: Information is stored in a retrievable format

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle case where repository doesn't exist: Document error and identify alternative
- [ ] Handle case where git is not initialized: Document and use alternative method
- [ ] Handle case where uncommitted changes exist: Document them with justification for ignoring
- [ ] Handle case where commit SHA is invalid: Re-verify and capture again

### Testing

- [ ] Verify commit SHA can be checked out: `git checkout <sha>`
- [ ] Verify commit SHA matches current HEAD: `git rev-parse HEAD`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - this is a verification task only

### Documentation

- [ ] Record commit SHA, branch name, date in a text file or document
- [ ] Document any uncommitted changes found
- [ ] Document which repository was used as primary reference

### Verification

- [ ] Verify commit SHA is valid and can be checked out
- [ ] Verify all information is accurately recorded
- [ ] Verify repository state is suitable for porting

## Notes

- This subtask is part of TASK-PY-001
- **Execution Timing**: Must be executed first, before all other tasks
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - The commit SHA is critical - it must be accurate
  - Uncommitted changes should be minimal or documented
  - This establishes the reference point for all porting work
- **Task Independence**: This subtask can be completed independently

## Related Tasks

- Parent: TASK-PY-001 (Confirm Baseline `cursor-runner` State)
- Next: TASK-PY-001.02 (Run Node.js Tests and Verify They Pass)
- Dependencies: None

## Definition of Done

This task involves **documentation and verification** work.

**Description**: Tasks that involve creating or updating documentation files and verification.

**Definition of Done**: "Commit SHA and repository state information are recorded and committed to git"

**User Stories**:
- As a **developer porting to Python**, I need a recorded commit SHA so I can always reference the exact Node.js state being ported
- As a **developer**, I need to know the repository state so I can trust the reference implementation

**Automated Tests**:
- Test that commit SHA is valid format (40 hex characters)
- Test that commit SHA can be checked out
- Test that recorded information is complete

**Commit and Push Requirements**:
- [ ] Create baseline note file with commit SHA and repository state
- [ ] Commit: `git add plan/python-converstion/baseline.md && git commit -m "TASK-PY-001.01: Capture Node.js repository baseline commit SHA"`
- [ ] Push to origin: `git push origin <branch-name>`
- [ ] Verify commit appears in remote repository

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] Commit SHA is captured and recorded
- [ ] Repository state is verified and documented
- [ ] Information is committed to git
- [ ] Commit SHA can be successfully checked out

## TASK-PY-016: End-to-End Lite Flows & Edge-Case Parity

**⚠️ CRITICAL: ALL IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES MUST BE MADE IN THE CURSOR-EXECUTOR APPLICATION ⚠️**

**Target Location**: All code changes, file creations, and modifications described in this task must be implemented in:
- **`python-cursor/cursor-executor/cursor-executor-back/`**

**DO NOT** make changes in:
- `python-cursor/cursor-runner/` (this is the Node.js reference implementation)
- Any other location

The `cursor-executor` application is the Python port target. All Python source code files, tests, configuration files, and documentation should be created or modified within the `cursor-executor-back` directory structure.

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Add E2E-lite tests (Python side) that:
  - [ ] Hit async iterate flows and verify callback behavior.
  - [ ] Exercise conversation and agent-conversation flows end-to-end (API → services → Redis/SQLite).
  - [ ] Exercise error paths (unknown repos, bad requests, internal errors) and verify response shapes.
- [ ] Compare behaviors and logs with Node for a small set of canonical scenarios.

### Testing
- [ ] Add tests under `tests/test_e2e_*` using a test app and temporary DBs.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Key workflows and edge cases behave equivalently between Node and Python, demonstrated by passing E2E-lite tests.

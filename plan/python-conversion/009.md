## TASK-PY-009: Implement Git Services (Git, Completion, GitHub Auth)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: ALL IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES MUST BE MADE IN THE CURSOR-EXECUTOR APPLICATION ⚠️**

**Target Location**: All code changes, file creations, and modifications described in this task must be implemented in:
- **`python-cursor/cursor-executor/cursor-executor-back/`**

**DO NOT** make changes in:
- `python-cursor/cursor-runner/` (this is the Node.js reference implementation)
- Any other location

The `cursor-executor` application is the Python port target. All Python source code files, tests, configuration files, and documentation should be created or modified within the `cursor-executor-back` directory structure.

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Implement `cursor_executor/services/git_service.py`:
  - [ ] Wrap `git` operations (clone, checkout, pull, push, list repos) with timeouts and logging.
- [ ] Implement `cursor_executor/services/git_completion_checker.py` equivalent to `git-completion-checker.ts`.
- [ ] Implement `cursor_executor/services/github_auth.py` to bootstrap non-interactive git config (tokens, SSH, etc.).

### Testing
- [ ] Add `tests/test_git_service.py` and related tests:
  - [ ] Use temp repos and/or mocks to simulate:
    - Invalid URLs.
    - Non-existent branches.
    - Merge conflicts.
  - [ ] Verify completion logic and error mapping.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Git operations and completion checks behave like Node's, with tests covering success and failure modes.

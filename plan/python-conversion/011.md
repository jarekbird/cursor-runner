## TASK-PY-011: Implement Conversation Service (Redis, Context, Summarization)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: ALL IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES MUST BE MADE IN THE CURSOR-EXECUTOR APPLICATION ⚠️**

**Target Location**: All code changes, file creations, and modifications described in this task must be implemented in:
- **`python-cursor/cursor-executor/cursor-executor-back/`**

**DO NOT** make changes in:
- `python-cursor/cursor-runner/` (this is the Node.js reference implementation)
- Any other location

The `cursor-executor` application is the Python port target. All Python source code files, tests, configuration files, and documentation should be created or modified within the `cursor-executor-back` directory structure.

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Implement `cursor_executor/services/conversation_service.py`:
  - [ ] Manage conversations in Redis keyed by queue type (`default`, `telegram`, `api`).
  - [ ] Implement `get_conversation_id`, `create_conversation`, `add_message`, `get_conversation_context`, and summarization logic.
  - [ ] Implement graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable (generate new IDs, log warnings, stop persisting).
- [ ] Implement summarization behavior:
  - [ ] Detect context-window errors from output (based on patterns defined in Node).
  - [ ] Compress conversation history into a summary + recent messages and persist as summarized context.

### Testing
- [ ] Add `tests/test_conversation_service.py`:
  - [ ] Use an in-memory or mocked Redis client.
  - [ ] Cover normal, Redis-down, and summarization error cases.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Conversation service behavior (including summarization and degradation) is parity-checked against Node via tests.

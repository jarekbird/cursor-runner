## TASK-PY-010: Implement Cursor CLI Wrapper (Execution Semantics)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: ALL IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES MUST BE MADE IN THE CURSOR-EXECUTOR APPLICATION ⚠️**

**Target Location**: All code changes, file creations, and modifications described in this task must be implemented in:
- **`python-cursor/cursor-executor/cursor-executor-back/`**

**DO NOT** make changes in:
- `python-cursor/cursor-runner/` (this is the Node.js reference implementation)
- Any other location

The `cursor-executor` application is the Python port target. All Python source code files, tests, configuration files, and documentation should be created or modified within the `cursor-executor-back` directory structure.

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Finish `cursor_executor/services/cursor_cli.py` with:
  - [ ] Concurrency semaphore mirroring `CURSOR_CLI_MAX_CONCURRENT`.
  - [ ] Main timeout and idle timeout behavior.
  - [ ] Safety timeout that guarantees semaphore release on edge cases.
  - [ ] Output-size caps.
  - [ ] Optional PTY-like behavior (if practical) for dealing with interactive prompts, or documented alternative.

### Testing
- [ ] Expand `tests/test_cursor_cli.py`:
  - [ ] Simulate long-running commands, idle commands, output floods.
  - [ ] Assert semaphore is always released.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Python cursor CLI wrapper can reproduce Node's timeout and concurrency behavior, per tests.

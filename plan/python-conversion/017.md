## TASK-PY-017: Docker, Compose, and CI Integration

**⚠️ CRITICAL: ALL IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES MUST BE MADE IN THE CURSOR-EXECUTOR APPLICATION ⚠️**

**Target Location**: All code changes, file creations, and modifications described in this task must be implemented in:
- **`python-cursor/cursor-executor/cursor-executor-back/`**

**DO NOT** make changes in:
- `python-cursor/cursor-runner/` (this is the Node.js reference implementation)
- Any other location

The `cursor-executor` application is the Python port target. All Python source code files, tests, configuration files, and documentation should be created or modified within the `cursor-executor-back` directory structure.

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Create a Python `Dockerfile` for `cursor-executor`:
  - [ ] Install dependencies, copy code, run tests at build (optional).
- [ ] Update or create `docker-compose` files to:
  - [ ] Run Python service with Redis and SQLite volumes matching Node deployment.
- [ ] Add CI workflows or scripts to:
  - [ ] Run linters and formatters.
  - [ ] Run type checks.
  - [ ] Run `pytest` with coverage.

### Testing
- [ ] Build and run the Docker image locally; hit `/health` and a few core endpoints.
- [ ] Run CI pipeline locally or in GitHub to ensure all checks pass.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Python service can be built and run in containers alongside existing stack.
- [ ] CI reliably validates code quality and tests.

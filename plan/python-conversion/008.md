## TASK-PY-008: Implement Workspace Trust Service

**⚠️ CRITICAL: ALL IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES MUST BE MADE IN THE CURSOR-EXECUTOR APPLICATION ⚠️**

**Target Location**: All code changes, file creations, and modifications described in this task must be implemented in:
- **`python-cursor/cursor-executor/cursor-executor-back/`**

**DO NOT** make changes in:
- `python-cursor/cursor-runner/` (this is the Node.js reference implementation)
- Any other location

The `cursor-executor` application is the Python port target. All Python source code files, tests, configuration files, and documentation should be created or modified within the `cursor-executor-back` directory structure.

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Implement `cursor_executor/services/workspace_trust_service.py`:
  - [ ] Enforce allowed roots for repositories and target apps.
  - [ ] Provide checks similar to Node's `workspace-trust-service.ts`.
- [ ] Integrate workspace trust checks into filesystem, git, and cursor-execution flows where appropriate.

### Testing
- [ ] Add `tests/test_workspace_trust_service.py` covering:
  - [ ] Allowed vs disallowed paths.
  - [ ] Behavior when trust configuration is missing or invalid.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Workspace trust is enforced consistently in Python, with tests demonstrating security behavior.

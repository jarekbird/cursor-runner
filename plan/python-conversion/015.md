## TASK-PY-015: Implement Feature Flags and MCP/Gmail Integration Hooks

**⚠️ CRITICAL: ALL IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES MUST BE MADE IN THE CURSOR-EXECUTOR APPLICATION ⚠️**

**Target Location**: All code changes, file creations, and modifications described in this task must be implemented in:
- **`python-cursor/cursor-executor/cursor-executor-back/`**

**DO NOT** make changes in:
- `python-cursor/cursor-runner/` (this is the Node.js reference implementation)
- Any other location

The `cursor-executor` application is the Python port target. All Python source code files, tests, configuration files, and documentation should be created or modified within the `cursor-executor-back` directory structure.

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Implement `cursor_executor/utils/feature_flags.py` mirroring Node feature flags.
- [ ] Implement Gmail/MCP-related helpers and configuration checks analogous to:
  - [ ] `mcp-config.test.ts`.
  - [ ] `mcp-config-feature-flag.test.ts`.
  - [ ] `test_gmail_integration.test.ts`.
  - [ ] `system-settings-gmail-validation.test.ts`.

### Testing
- [ ] Port the Node tests for MCP/Gmail config into Python tests.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Feature flags and MCP/Gmail config handling behave identically to Node, per tests.

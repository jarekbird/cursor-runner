## TASK-PY-018: Integration with `jarek-va` and Rollout

**⚠️ CRITICAL: ALL IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES MUST BE MADE IN THE CURSOR-EXECUTOR APPLICATION ⚠️**

**Target Location**: All code changes, file creations, and modifications described in this task must be implemented in:
- **`python-cursor/cursor-executor/cursor-executor-back/`**

**DO NOT** make changes in:
- `python-cursor/cursor-runner/` (this is the Node.js reference implementation)
- Any other location

The `cursor-executor` application is the Python port target. All Python source code files, tests, configuration files, and documentation should be created or modified within the `cursor-executor-back` directory structure.

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Identify all places where `jarek-va` calls `cursor-runner` and make the base URL configurable.
- [ ] Introduce a flag or environment switch to route traffic to `cursor-executor` instead of Node for test/staging.
- [ ] Run real-world tasks through `cursor-executor` and compare results with Node:
  - [ ] At least one complex feature task.
  - [ ] At least one review-agent flow.

### Testing
- [ ] Add integration tests or scripts in `jarek-va` that can target Python or Node backends.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] `cursor-executor` can be used as a drop-in replacement for `cursor-runner` in non-production environments.
- [ ] A clear path is documented for moving production traffic over once confidence is high.

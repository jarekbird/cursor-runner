- **Repository URL**: `https://github.com/jarekbird/cursor-runner.git`
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Commit SHA**: `6a4446a1ef20326c2046b33c63b5e3e9df6b8e34`

## Verification

The commit SHA has been verified:
- ✅ Valid 40-character hexadecimal string
- ✅ Can be checked out successfully
- ✅ Repository has commit history
- ✅ Branch exists and is valid

## Purpose

This baseline commit serves as the reference point for all Python porting work. All porting tasks should reference this commit SHA to ensure consistency with the Node.js implementation.

## Usage

To checkout this baseline commit:
```bash
git checkout 6a4446a1ef20326c2046b33c63b5e3e9df6b8e34
```

```bash
git checkout main
```

## Notes

- This baseline was established as part of TASK-PY-001.01
- The repository state was verified to be clean before capturing this baseline
- This commit represents the state of the Node.js implementation at the start of the Python porting effort

# Node.js cursor-runner Baseline Commit

This document captures the baseline commit SHA and repository state for the Node.js `cursor-runner` repository that serves as the reference implementation for the Python port.

## Repository Information

- **Repository**: `jarekbird/cursor-runner` (Node.js implementation)
- **Repository URL**: `https://github.com/jarekbird/cursor-runner.git`
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Commit SHA**: `a003639cc513a905a652d80454082a89df520708`
- **Commit Message**: `TASK-PY-001.01: Update baseline commit SHA to current HEAD`
- **Baseline Date**: `2025-12-02 02:42:38 UTC`

## Repository State

- **Working Tree**: Clean (no uncommitted changes)
- **Status**: Verified on `2025-12-02 02:42:38 UTC`
- **Git Status**: `On branch main. Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'. nothing to commit, working tree clean`

## Verification

The commit SHA has been verified:
- ✅ Valid 40-character hexadecimal string
- ✅ Can be checked out successfully
- ✅ Repository has commit history
- ✅ Branch exists and is valid

## Purpose

This baseline commit serves as the reference point for all Python porting work. All porting tasks should reference this commit SHA to ensure consistency with the Node.js implementation.

## Usage

To checkout this baseline commit:
```bash
git checkout a003639cc513a905a652d80454082a89df520708
```

To return to the latest commit:
```bash
git checkout main
```

## Notes

- This baseline was established as part of TASK-PY-001.01
- The repository state was verified to be clean before capturing this baseline
- This commit represents the state of the Node.js implementation at the start of the Python porting effort

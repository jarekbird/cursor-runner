## TASK-PY-014: Implement HTTP API Layer (Routes and Contracts)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: ALL IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES MUST BE MADE IN THE CURSOR-EXECUTOR APPLICATION ⚠️**

**Target Location**: All code changes, file creations, and modifications described in this task must be implemented in:
- **`python-cursor/cursor-executor/cursor-executor-back/`**

**DO NOT** make changes in:
- `python-cursor/cursor-runner/` (this is the Node.js reference implementation)
- Any other location

The `cursor-executor` application is the Python port target. All Python source code files, tests, configuration files, and documentation should be created or modified within the `cursor-executor-back` directory structure.

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] In `cursor_executor/api/server.py` (and routers), implement endpoints equivalent to Node:
  - [ ] `/health`, `/health/queue`.
  - [ ] `/cursor/execute`, `/cursor/execute/async`.
  - [ ] `/cursor/iterate`, `/cursor/iterate/async`.
  - [ ] `/cursor/conversation/new`.
  - [ ] `/conversations/api/*` (list, new, get, add message).
  - [ ] `/agent-conversations/api/*` (list, new, get, add message).
  - [ ] `/repositories/api/:repository/files`.
  - [ ] Any tasks and Telegram webhook routes that need parity.
- [ ] Map HTTP request/response shapes and status codes exactly to Node, using Pydantic models.

### Testing
- [ ] Add `tests/test_server.py`:
  - [ ] Unit/integration tests for each endpoint, using mocked services where needed.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All public HTTP endpoints exist in Python with contracts matching Node's, and tests verify core behaviors.
